<h1>TMCore Documentation</h1>
<p>
	TMCore is a programmer's toolkit for creating applications for the
	Microsoft .NET platform that use the Topic Maps paradigm. The TMCore 
	distribution consists of three related components. The <strong>Engine</strong>
	provides a complete programming interface to the TMCore system. The engine
	is implemented entirely as managed code and can be accessed from C#, VB.NET,
	or J#. The <strong>Topic Map Web Service</strong> provides a high-level transaction-oriented
	web services API which allows query, read and write operations over a web services
	interface with a simple XML syntax. The <strong>NPCL Web Service</strong> provides
	web service methods for retrieving the schema that governs a topic map or a single
	type in a topic map.
