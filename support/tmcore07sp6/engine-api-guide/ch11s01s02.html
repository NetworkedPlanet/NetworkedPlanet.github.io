      between instances of the types defined by the schema. NPCL has three
      kinds of constraints:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Occurrence Constraints</span></dt><dd><p>Occurrence Constraints are allowed only on Topic Types.
            These constraints specify the types of occurrences that are
            allowed on a topic of a specific Topic Type.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Role Player Constraints</span></dt><dd><p>Role Player Constraints are allowed only on Topic Types.
            They specify the types of roles in associations that can be played
            by a topic of a specific Topic Type.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Association Role Constraints</span></dt><dd><p>Association Role Constraints occur only on Association
            Types. They specify the types of roles that can be present in an
            association of a specific Association Type.</p></dd></dl></div><p>All of the constraints support the Minimum Cardinality and Maximum
      Cardinality facets which specify a numeric limit on the number of
      relationships (e.g. the number of occurrences of type "Age" that can
      appear on a topic of type "Person" could be limited to a minimum of 0
      and a maximum of 1). Some constraints provide additional rules about how
      topics can be related to each other. The following sections describe
      each constraint in more detail.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3123"></a>Occurrence Constraints</h4></div></div></div><p>An Occurrence Constraint specifies that a topic of a specific
        Topic Type can have occurrences of a specific Occurrence Type. The
        Minimum Cardinality and Maximum Cardinality facets specify how many
        occurrences of the Occurrence Type are allowed on any single instance
        of the Topic Type.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3128"></a>Role Player Constraints</h4></div></div></div><p>A Role Player Constraint specifies that a topic of a specific
        Topic Type can play a role of a specific Role Type. These constraints
        can also optionally limit the roles played to only those in an
        association of a specific Association Type.</p><p>The Minimum and Maximum Cardinality facets constrain how many
        roles of the specified Role Type any instance of the specified Topic
        Type may participate in.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3135"></a>Association Role Constraints</h4></div></div></div><p>An Association Role Constraint specifies that an association of
        a specific Association Type can have a role of a specific Role
        Type.</p><p>The Minimum and Maximum Cardinality facets constraint how many
        roles of the specified Role Type can appear on any single instance of
        the specified Association Type.</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>At this point it might seem confusing that there are limits on
          how many roles a topic can play and how many roles can appear in an
          association. However, the two controls apply in different
          circumstances. Consider a topic map in which we want to record
          people and the companies they work for. We want to record each
          Person-to-Company relationship as a separate association, but we
          recognise that a Company will have many employees and a Person may
          work for more than one company. We create topic types "Person" and
          "Company", association type "Employment" and Role Types "Employee"
          and "Employer". In this example, we would allow the Person Topic
          Type to play 0 or more roles of type "Employee" and the "Company"
          topic type to play 0 or more roles of type "Employer", using the
          Cardinality facets on the Role Player Constraints. However, to
          ensure that we keep each Person-Company relationship in a separate
          associaction, we would restrict the "Employment" Association Type to
          have exactly one role of type "Employer" and exactly one role of
          type "Employee" (set Minimum and Maximum Cardinality to "1").</p></div><p>The Association Role Constraint also supports an additional Arc
        Label Facet. This facet specifies a default human-readable label for
        the role. This label should be the way to describe the association
        relationship when seen from the point of view of the role player. For
        example an association describing the relationship between a person
        and the company they work for might be represented using the
        Association Type "Employment", with Role Types "Employee" and
        "Employer". This implies that there are two Association Role
        Constraints, one between the Association Type "Employment" and the
        Role Type "Employee" and the other between the Association Type
        "Employment" and the Role Type "Employer". For the "Employee" Role
        Type, a suitable arc label might be "Works For" whereas for the
        "Employer" Role Type we might use "Employs".</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s01s01.html"><img src="../graphics/prev.png" alt="Prev"></a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch11s01.html"><img src="../graphics/up.png" alt="Up"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch11s01s03.html"><img src="../graphics/next.png" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Types&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="../graphics/home.png" alt="Home"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Superclass-Subclass Inheritance</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
