      associations and association roles. The Topic Maps model allows all of
      these constructs to be assigned a type. NPCL allows you to specify what
      types are present in your topic map, and what constructs each type can
      be used on. For example, it would allow you to say that the topic
      "Person" can be used as the type of other topics, but not as the type of
      an occurrence or association.</p><p>Types are specified by defining which
      <span class="emphasis"><em>meta-type</em></span> they belong to. The meta-type is simply
      the topic map construct that the type can be applied to. NPCL defines
      the following 4 meta-types:</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td>Topic Type - types belonging to this meta-type can be used as
        the type of topics in the topic map.</td></tr><tr><td>Occurrence Type - types belonging to this meta-type can be
        used as the type of occurrence in the topic map.</td></tr><tr><td>Association Type - types belonging to this meta-type can be
        used as the type of associations in the topic map.</td></tr><tr><td>Role Type - types belonging to this meta-type can be used as
        the type of association roles in the topic map.</td></tr></table><p>Any type can belong to more than one meta-type. It is allowed, for
      example to say that the topic "Website" is both a Topic Type and an
      Occurrence Type.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3025"></a>Type Facets</h4></div></div></div><p>Some of the meta-types allow type definitions to carry
        additional information in the form of facets. Facets are simply string
        properties with a special pre-defined meaning.</p><p>The following sections describe the facets defined by NPCL and
        how they are used.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e3032"></a>Is Abstract Facet</h5></div></div></div><p>This facet is found on Topic Types, Occurrence Types,
          Association Types and Role Types. Its value is a simple boolean
          string (either "true" or "false"). If the value is "true", this
          indicates that the type cannot be instantiated - that is that the
          user should be prevented from creating a topic, occurrence,
          association or role of that type. Although users cannot create
          instances of types marked as abstract, these types can still be used
          in the definition of constraints and these constraint definitions
          are then inherited by subclasses, which may be instantiated by
          users.</p><p>For example we may define an "Employment" association. We want
          to say that the "Employer" role can be played by either a "Person"
          or a "Company". Both "Person" and "Company" derive from a common
          superclass "Legal Entity". We can specify that "Legal Entity" is a
          Topic Type and then use it to define a Role Player Constraint that
          says that topics of type "Legal Entity" can play the role
          "Employer". However to force users to create topics that are either
          instances of "Person" or "Company" and to prevent them from creating
          topics of type "Legal Entity", we can add the Is Abstract facet to
          the type</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e3039"></a>Scoping Facet</h5></div></div></div><p>This facet is found on Topic Types. It defines how instances
          of the Topic Type can be used in scoping other constructs in the
          topic map. Topics can be used to define the scope of topic names,
          occurrences or associations. By applying this facet to a Topic Type,
          you can specify that instances of the Topic Type can be used only to
          scope one of these constructs or any combination of them.</p><p>The string value of this facet should be one or more of the
          following strings (separated by spaces, tabs or carriage returns if
          you specify more than one).</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">NAME</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates that topics of this type can be used to scope
                topic names.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">OCCURRENCE</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates that topics of this type can be used to scope
                occurrence on topics.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">ASSOCIATION</span></dt><dd><p>Indicates that topics of this type can be used to scope
                associations between topics.</p></dd></dl></div><p>For example, you may create a Topic Type "Language", the
          instances of this Topic Type would be topics such as "English",
          "French", "Klingon" and so on. It makes sense to allow the use of
          these topics to scope names and occurrences, but not much sense to
          allow them to scope associations as associations between topics are
          (almost always) language-independent. To specify this rule in NPCL,
          you simply add a Scoping Facet to the "Language" Topic Type with the
          value "NAME OCCURRENCE" (or "OCCURRENCE NAME" - the ordering is
          irrelevant).</p><p>By default, if no value is provided for the Scoping Facet of a
          Topic Type, it is assumed that instances of the Topic Type should
          not be used for scoping.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e3069"></a>Value Datatype Facet</h5></div></div></div><p>This facet is allowed on Occurrence Types. It defines the
          datatype of the value of any occurrence typed by the Occurrence
          Type. A datatype is simply the kind of value that is allowed on the
          occurrence - for example a "Date Of Birth" Occurrence Type might
          only allow values that are of a "date" datatype.</p><p>NPCL does not pre-define a set of datatypes. This is
          deliberate, as different applications and different topic map
          ontologies will have different requirements with regards to
          datatypes. However we recommend that unless you have unusual
          datatyping requirements, you should use the set of URI identifiers
          for datatypes that are defined by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/" target="_top"> Part 2 of the W3C XML
          Schema specification </a> (as noted in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#schema" target="_top"> the schema for XML
          Schema Datatypes</a>, the URI Identifier for a data type is
          simply the URI of the XML Schema namespace, followed by a fragment
          identifier which is the name of the datatype - e.g.
          http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e3082"></a>Minimum Value and Maximum Value Facets</h5></div></div></div><p>These facets are allowed on Occurrence Types and are used to
          specify the lower and upper bound on the range of acceptable values
          for occurrences typed by the Occurrence Type. For example a "Batting
          Average" Occurrence Type might be given a Minimum Value facet of
          "0.0" and a Maximum Value of "1.0".</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e3087"></a>Value Pattern Facet</h5></div></div></div><p>The Value Pattern facet is allowed on Occurrence Types and is
          used to specify a regular expression that defines the acceptable
          values for occurrences typed by the Occurrence Type. The regular
          expression should follow the syntax defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#regexs" target="_top"> Appendix F of Part 2
          of the W3C XML Schema specification </a>.</p><p>For example an occurrence of the Occurrence Type "Price" could
          be restricted to one or more digits followed by a decimal point and
          two further digits by setting the Value Pattern Facet for the
          "Price" Occurrence Type to "(\d)+.\d\d".</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s01.html"><img src="../graphics/prev.png" alt="Prev"></a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch11s01.html"><img src="../graphics/up.png" alt="Up"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch11s01s02.html"><img src="../graphics/next.png" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Key Concepts&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="../graphics/home.png" alt="Home"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Constraints</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
