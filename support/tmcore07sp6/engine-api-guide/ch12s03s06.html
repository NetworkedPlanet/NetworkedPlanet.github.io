      examine a topic map to determine what types exist and how they are used.
      The programming interface to this engine is the method
      InferSchema(ITopicMap, string) in the class
      NetworkedPlanet.Npcl.SchemaUtils. To use this method you must pass in
      the ITopicMap handle to the topic map you want to evaluate, and the base
      URI to be used for generated subject identifiers. The base URI string
      you pass in can be null, in which case the base URI defaults to the
      special prefix 'urn:x-tmcore:topicid'.</p><p>The inference proceeds by querying the topic map to determine what
      topics are being used as types; which types of occurrences occur on
      which types of topics; which types of association roles appear in which
      types of associations; and which types of topics play which types of
      association role. The inference also attempts to determine what types of
      topics are being used in scopes and will read and reflect the
      superclass-subclass hierarchy if you have used the XTM-defined subject
      identifiers for the superclass-subclass association type and related
      role types.</p><p>The inference has a number of limitations and failsafes that you
      should be aware of:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If a topic is found that is used as a type, NPCL requires that
          the topic must have a subject identifier. If the topic does not
          already have at least one subject identifier, one will be generated
          for it. This generated subject identifier will be base URI prefix
          specified in the method parameters followed by the name of the topic
          forced into lower case. So if you specify the base URI prefix as
          'http://www.mycompany.com/psi/general/', then the topic with the
          name "Sales Forecast" will get the generated subject identifier
          'http://www.mycompany.com/psi/general/sales forecast'.</p><p>If you pass in NULL as the base URI prefix, then topics will
          be assigned a URI of the form 'urn:x-tmcore:topicid:' followed by
          the database object identifier of the topic. This special form of
          URI is recognised by the NPCL TopicMapSchemaWriter class, which will
          find the topic to be updated using its object identifier rather than
          a subject indicator. This feature is provided to allow you to
          generate an NPCL schema from a topic map and then import the schema
          into that topic map without creatin duplicates of topics that did
          not originally have subject identifiers. You should NOT use this
          feature to create an NPCL schema that you then intend to import into
          a different topic map.</p></li><li><p>Cardinality constraints are generated to be rather lax.
          Occurrence and role player constraints are generated as either '0 or
          more' or '1 or more' constraints. A '1 or more' constriant is
          generated only if every topic of the given type would conform to
          that constraint. Association role constraints minimum cardinality is
          generated as 0 or 1 (only if all associations of the given type have
          at least one role that conforms), and maximum cardinality is
          generated as either unbounded or 1 (only if all associations of the
          given type have no more than one role that conforms). You may wish
          to review the generated constraints and make them tighter in certain
          applications.</p></li><li><p>The inference process makes no attempt to infer datatype,
          minimum value, maximum value or value pattern facets for occurrence
          types. You should add these manually if they are required.</p></li><li><p>When a topic is used in a scope, the inference engine works as
          follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>If the scoping topic is also a role type and the scoped
              item is a topic name, the topic is ignored (role types are often
              used to scope association type names to provide
              context-sensitive association labels - these are one-off usages
              and would make the NPCL schema grow unmanageably if they were
              all recorded).</p></li><li><p>If the scoping topic is typed, then the appropriate
              scoping facet value is added to the topic type. So if a topic
              "English" is used to scope a topic name, and the "English" topic
              has the type "Language", then the scoping facet value for the
              type "Language" will include NAME as one of its values.</p></li><li><p>If the scoping topic is untyped, then a new Scoping Topic
              is generated in the schema to represent it. Note, that this
              <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> occurs if the scoping topic is not
              typed.</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div><div class="example"><a name="d0e4458"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;12.5.&nbsp;Generating An NPCL Schema File From A Topic Map</b></p><p>The following code snippet shows how the schema inference engine
