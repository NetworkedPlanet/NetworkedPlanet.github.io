      own code. TMRQL is simply SQL applied to a defined set of relational
      views of your topic map data. This makes TMRQL easy to use for anyone
      already familiar with SQL and also has the advantage of extensive
      support in tools an in code from the .NET Framework.</p><p>The code in APIExample4 performs the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Import an XTM file into the database - this is the source data
          that will be queried. The source data is a partial genealogy of the
          British monarchy.</p></li><li><p>Execute a simple TMRQL query that finds all of the children of
          King William I (William the Conquerer) and list the IDs and names of
          the topics for those children.</p></li><li><p>Execute a more complex TMRQL query that makes use of a
          TMRQL-defined function that returns all descendants of King William
          I as a DataTable. That DataTable is then processed locally to create
          a simple tree view of the descendants.</p></li></ol></div><p>The code for importing the XTM file is contained in the method
      <code class="methodname">ImportXTMFile()</code> - this is similar to the code
      already seen in APIExample3 for XTM import.</p><p>The query for the direct children of William I is done in the
      method QueryChildren(). In this query, we want to find all topics
      associated with the topic for William I where the association type is
      "child-of" and William I plays the role "parent". William I, "child-of"
      and "parent" are all topics in the topic map an need to be found in the
      database to perform this query. In this example, this is done as part of
      th query itself, using the topic subject identifiers and looking up the
      topic's unique identifiers using SQL sub-selects. The actual query
      string used is slightly obscured by the use of string constants for the
      base URIs of the subject identifiers, so is reproduced here in its
      complete form except for the string <em class="replaceable"><code>{topicmap
      ID}</code></em> which is replaced with the
      <span class="property">ObjectID</span> of the
      <code class="interfacename">ITopicMap</code> object passed into the
      <code class="methodname">QueryChildren()</code> method:</p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT r2p, dbo.tm_displayName(r2p) FROM tm_assoc2 WHERE
  topicmap = <em class="replaceable"><code>{topicmap ID}</code></em> AND 
  r1p in (SELECT topic_id from tm_si where subj_id='http://www.example.com/psi/uk-monarchs/william-i') AND 
  association_type in (SELECT topic_id from tm_si where subj_id='http://www.example.com/psi/family/child-of') AND
  r1t in (SELECT topic_id from tm_si where subj_id='http://www.example.com/psi/family/parent')</pre><p>The principal selection is done using the tm_assoc2 view which
      presents pairs of topics that are in the same association, giving the
      association type and the role type played by each topic. Each of the
      topics William I, "child-of" and "parent" are found using a lookup in
      the tm_si view which maps a topic's subject identifier to its unique
      object identifier. In the SELECT part of the query, the tm_displayName
      function is used to select one name from the topic specified in the
      function parameter. The query is executed using the
      <code class="methodname">ExecuteQuery()</code> method of the
      <code class="interfacename">ITopicMapSystem</code> interface, not on the
      <code class="interfacename">ITopicMap</code> interface. Although this query
      specifically restricts itself to a single topic map, but you can write
      queries that span multiple topic maps in the same database (although you
      will then need to be responsible for working out which results came from
      which topic map!). The exection and procesing of the results set is
      shown in the code snippet below.</p><pre class="programlisting">ITMCoreDataReader dr = tm.TopicMapSystem.ExecuteQuery(query);
System.Console.WriteLine("Children of William I:");
try 
{
  while (dr.Read()) 
  {
    int id = dr.GetInt32(0);
    string name = dr.GetString(1);
    System.Console.WriteLine("  {0} - {1}", id, name);
  }
} 
finally 
{
  dr.Close();
}</pre><p>The <code class="methodname">ExecuteQuery()</code> method returns an
      instance of the <code class="interfacename">ITMCoreDataReader</code>
      interface which extends the standard SQL DataReader implementation with
      additional methods that can return full TMAPI objects from object
      identifiers in the results set. As with a normal
      <code class="interfacename">DataReader</code>, you can call the
      <code class="methodname">Read()</code> method to retrieve results row by row
      until the method returns false (at which point you have reached the end
      of the results set). You can then use the various
      <code class="methodname">Get<em class="replaceable"><code>XXX</code></em>()</code> methods to
      retrieve individual items from the row - in this case the unique object
      identifier is retrieved as a 32-bit integer, and the topic name is
      retrieved as a string.</p><div class="warning"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>You must always ensure that you call the
        <code class="methodname">Close()</code> method on the
        <code class="interfacename">ITMCoreDataReader</code> interface when you
        are done with it. Placing this call in the finally section of a try
        block is the easiest way to ensure that the data reader is always
        closed - even if an exception occurs when processing a row of the
        results set.</p></div><p>The method QueryDescendents() prints a tree-view of all
      descendants of William I. This list is found by following the "child-of"
      associations (from "parent" role to "child" role") starting from William
      I. We call this traversal of a specific type of association in a
      specific direction (from one role type to another role type) as
      transitive closure. TMRQL provides two functions for retrieving this
      transitive closure. The tm_tc function is provided for backwards
      compatibility, but we recommend you use the tm_tc2 function which
      returns a table listing each path in the transitive closure as a pair of
      topics - the "from" topic and the "to" topic. If you think of the
      transitive closure like a tree, the "from" topic is the parent node and
      the "to" topic is the child node.</p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Although it is often the case that these functions are used to
        retrieve tree structures, in fact the tm_tc and tm_tc2 functions are
        capable of handling cyclic references as well as straightforward
        hierarchies.</p></div><p>This method also shows a different way of constructing a query
      that requires topic identifiers. Rather than querying for the
      identifiers within the query string itself, the topics are first located
      using the Index APIs to lookup the topics one by one. This can be useful
      when you write a lot of queries that use the same topics over and over
      again. The code for the QueryDescendants() method is shown below.</p><pre class="programlisting">string familyPsiBase = "http://www.example.com/psi/family/";
string monarchyPsiBase = "http://www.example.com/psi/uk-monarchs/";
ITopic childOf = tm.TopicsIndex.GetTopicBySubjectIdentifier(familyPsiBase + "child-of");
ITopic child = tm.TopicsIndex.GetTopicBySubjectIdentifier(familyPsiBase + "child");
ITopic parent = tm.TopicsIndex.GetTopicBySubjectIdentifier(familyPsiBase + "parent");
ITopic william = tm.TopicsIndex.GetTopicBySubjectIdentifier(monarchyPsiBase + "william-i");
string query = String.Format(
  "SELECT from_id, to_id, dbo.tm_displayName(to_id) as child_name from tm_tc2({0},{1},{2},{3})",
  william.ObjectID, childOf.ObjectID, parent.ObjectID, child.ObjectID);
try 
{
  ITMCoreDataReader dr = tm.TopicMapSystem.ExecuteQuery(query);
  System.Data.DataTable tbl = dr.GetDataTable();
  System.Console.WriteLine("William I:");
  ListChildren(tbl, Int32.Parse(william.ObjectID), 2);
} 
catch (Exception ex) 
{
  System.Console.WriteLine("ERROR: Caught error in processing query.");
  System.Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}</pre><p>The first 6 lines of the code are used to find the topics that are
      required to execute the tm_tc2 function. This function requires the
      identifiers of the starting topic for the closure, the type of the
      association to be traversed, the type of role played by the "from" topic
      at each link in the path and the type of role played by the "to" topic
      at each link. Because these topics are located first using the Index
      API, the query string can be much simpler - requiring only that the
      ObjectID of each topic be inserted into the correct place in the query.
      This code example differs from the previous query in another way too.
      Rather than reading the results set row by row, the code makes use of
      the GetDataTable() method provided by the ITMCoreDataReader interface.
      This method reads all the rows from the results set into a local
      System.Data.DataTable instance and then closes the DataReader. For large
      results sets, this could potentially require a lot of memory, but it has
      several advantages. Firstly it means that you do not have to explicitly
      close the DataReader as this is done by the code that constructs the
      DataTable. Secondly, the DataTable interface provides a number of
      methods that allow you to filter and select from the results data
      without executing further queries against the database. This second
      feature is used by the method ListChildren() which is a recursive method
      used to construct the tree view. Each time the ListChildren() method is
      invoked, it selects from the DataTable all those rows where the "from"
      topic identifier matches the identifier specified in the input
      parameter. Then for each row it prints the id and name of the "to" topic
      (the child) and then calls itself with the child topic identifier as the
      parameter to print the list of the child's children and so on. This code
      is shown in the snippet below.</p><pre class="programlisting">private void ListChildren(System.Data.DataTable descendantsTable, int parentId, int indent)
{
  System.Data.DataRow[] children = descendantsTable.Select("from_id=" + parentId, "child_name");
  foreach(System.Data.DataRow childRow in children)
  {
    int childId = (int)childRow[1];
    string childName = childRow[2] as String;
    System.Console.WriteLine("{0}{1} - {2}", new String(' ', indent), childId, childName);
    ListChildren(descendantsTable, childId, indent + 2);
  }
