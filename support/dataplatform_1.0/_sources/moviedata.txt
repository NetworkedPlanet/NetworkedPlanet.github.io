Movies Example
=======================================================

 .. note:: For the purposes of this example, we will be working with a website set up to use the default Orchard installation domain of http://localhost:30321.
 
 In the Data Platform installed directory there is a folder named example data, a TTL (Turtle) file, **movies.ttl**, is included that has a small number of triples describing some basic information about 10 movies.
 
 Go to the Data Platform main admin page on your site and create a new dataset called Movies.

 Go to the Upload tab to add data to the dataset

 The successful upload of data starts up secondary background tasks for calculating dataset statistics and data dump files. The background tasks only run every minute in the website, so the tasks will not appear or run immediately after uploading data.
 
 .. note:: Data dump files will only be exported if the dataset is already published, if the dataset is not yet published it will skip the export, and create a data dump file when the dataset is first published.

Go to the dataset metadata page and set a URI from the movies.ttl file to use as an example resource URI. For example:: 

	http://localhost:30321/movies/the-matrix

will display that resource's properties as a preview on the dataset page along with the other metadata of the dataset

 Publish the dataset using the Publish button

 View the dataset to see how the dataset metadata appears to visitors of the site. The design will depend on what Theme you have installed on the website.
