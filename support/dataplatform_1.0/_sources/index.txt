Data Platform Documentation
=======================================================

The Data Platform is developed by `Networked Planet <http://www.networkedplanet.com/>`_, a software company specialising in semantic data. Our Data Platform makes it incredibly easy for any company or organisation to host and describe datasets, with minimum fuss.

The sections below outline the simple steps to set up the Data Platform, and there are links to more explanatory pages about the different features of the Data Platform.
