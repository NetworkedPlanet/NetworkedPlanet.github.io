<p>Topic Clouds are extensions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud" class="filelink">Tag Clouds</a>, commonly used on the web as an efficient way of showing a set of available options or tags to the user, along with a visual metric indicating the relative importance of the tag to the user. Example of different styles being applied to a topic cloud are shown below.</p>
