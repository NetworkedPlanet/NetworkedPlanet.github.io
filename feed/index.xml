        <title>The Way Ahead - Data Sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;http://londonfunders.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/SME574%20London%20Funders%20Report_For%20Web.pdf&quot;&gt;The Review of the Future of Civil Society Support in London&lt;/a&gt; was published by London Funders, working closely with Greater London Volunteering and the London Voluntary Service Council. The Review’s emerging findings report The Change Ahead described the rapidly and dramatically changing world in which civil society operates. The Review Team believed that &lt;strong&gt;organisations and individuals that support civil society need to adapt, evolve and innovate at a systems-wide level&lt;/strong&gt; to address these changes, so that the best outcomes can be achieved for Londoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report made twelve recommendations for action, gathered under five key themes, each addressed by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewayahead.london/about/task-and-finish-groups&quot;&gt;Task and Finish group&lt;/a&gt;. In November, Lea began working with Kate White (of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superhighways.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Superhighways&lt;/a&gt;), co-chairing the Task and Finish group for the “Data Sharing” theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead proposes a system that puts London’s communities at the heart of the way we all work.  It begins with co-producing an understanding of need and how to tackle it with our communities, through to better sharing of intelligence and data across all sectors, and making sure that civil society’s voice is heard in decision-making at a strategic level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/twa/parts.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Way Ahead - Twelve Recommendations&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data-sharing-theme&quot;&gt;The Data Sharing Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The GLA (Greater London Authority) currently plays an important role for other sectors in collating data, analysing it and making it accessible. Civil society is a large and important contributor to London, and as such the GLA should extend its data role to encompass civil society.  As co-produced needs data is developed, it could be pulled together by the GLA. Over time, this data would provide a clearer and shared understanding of need as it evolves across London, which is accepted by funders, civil society and communities themselves, and could be incorporated into strategic planning at all levels.  Data about the sector itself is also important for planning, for example on the size, location and nature of civil society in different areas of London as it correlates to communities needs; the nature of volunteers, including where they volunteer, and to what issues they contribute.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Data Sharing Task and Finish group was set up, Lea and Kate have been meeting with funders, voluntary sector leaders, and charities in order to produce a report of recommendations to The Way Ahead’s steering group. The report has now been submitted, but the work doesn’t end here! To stay up to date with news, visit the newly launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewayahead.london/&quot;&gt;thewayahead.london&lt;/a&gt; website. We’ll also continue to post updates here on the blog about the intelligence gathered during our meetings throughout The Way Ahead’s Data Sharing research. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DataDock and CSVW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we publish anything on the web it should go without saying that in order for that distributed information to be usable, we must adhere to standards when we publish it. If everyone had their own way of marking some text in a web page to be &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, web page browsers would have an impossible task of displaying that text in the way it was meant to be shown. That’s why we have the standard markup language of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/html/&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; to enable everyone to publish web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when we publish data on the web we should look to standards to ensure consistency and interoperability between distributed data publishers and any applications that need to pull that data into their systems. DataDock currently makes use of two main recommended approaches to publishing data on the web - “CSV on the Web” (CSVW) and Linked Data. This blog post will concentrate on CSVW and there will be a follow up for those interested in Linked Data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;DataDock&lt;/a&gt;’s processing pipeline is to take a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Comma Separated Values&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/abbr&gt; file of tabular data, and open it to allow the DataDock user some basic control over how that data should be processed. Whilst the current amount of user control over the CSV processing is straightforward datatype selection of the different columns, we will be rapidly expanding DataDock’s abilities to allow more user control over defining the structure of the CSV they are publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/csvw/columns.png&quot; alt=&quot;CSV columns list&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The W3C’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;CSV on the Web Working Group&lt;/a&gt; developed specifications relating to describing tabular data. This makes it the obvious choice for us to adopt this standard when we pull the CSV into the DataDock processing pipeline. There is now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/community/csvw/&quot;&gt;W3C CSV on the Web Community Group that is open to all&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a focus on discussion and support for implementors, publishers and spec developers to share experience with CSVW and related ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the CSVW specification, DataDock takes the information entered by the user (e.g. title / description / selected license) and combines it with the list of columns to produce a metadata JSON file. An example of one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jennet/odcamp-demo/blob/gh-pages/csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv-metadata.json&quot;&gt;metadata JSON files&lt;/a&gt; produced during the import of a CSV into DataDock is shown below (the example below only shows the first four of the columns for brevity):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jennet/1b681faa594f86a2a417302c96600575.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current release, DataDock auto-creates the column definitions, creating the machine-friendly &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;property_url&lt;/code&gt; from each column’s header value, which is set as the initial value in &lt;code&gt;titles&lt;/code&gt;. DataDock currently asks for user input only when it comes to the column’s &lt;code&gt;datatype&lt;/code&gt;, although it does make a simple guess at the datatype based on the values of the first non-header row of the selected CSV. Future upgrades to the DataDock platform will make use of the more extended definitions of the CSVW standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the CSVW metadata file has been created, DataDock’s conversion process uses the metadata file to generate &lt;abbr title=&quot;Resource Description Framework&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/abbr&gt; linked data. The DataDock then uses the linked data to generate the pages for the data portal, and publishes all this to the user’s target GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each DataDock repository has a “csv” directory that contains a sub-directory for each dataset. This contains the original CSV upload along with its CSVW metadata JSON file. You can find the CSV and CSVW metadata relating to the examples from the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/03/01/connecting-the-dots.html&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jennet/odcamp-demo/tree/gh-pages/csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv&quot;&gt;my GitHub repo here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who want to learn a bit more about CSVW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greggkellogg.net/%3Fp%3D293&quot;&gt;a more in-depth blog post is available by Gregg Kellogg&lt;/a&gt;, or if you’re a documentation geek then feel free to dive into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;recommendations and notes published by the CSVW working group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that future versions of the DataDock will include an API layer, and that this may handle more complex CSV processing using supplied metadata files. If that’s something that you would be interested in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NetworkedPlanet/datadock/issues&quot;&gt;make it known as a feature request&lt;/a&gt; on our support site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next blog post will dive into the linked data part of the publishing pipeline. It’s that side of things that the most exciting for me personally, because as we add enhancements to the CSVW &lt;code&gt;property_url&lt;/code&gt; definition user control, we can add features to publish and reuse standard vocabulary terms to define the data published from disparate sources - whilst keeping this standard of data publishing free and as easy as possible for non-technical people to use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecting the dots in your data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get stuck into the more technical aspects of DataDock, I’d like to first show a little example of one of the benefits of having a deep-dive data portal, over that of a catalog of datasets. If you’ve not yet read it, have a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/28/introducing-datadock.html&quot;&gt;Introduction to DataDock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many data publishing platforms provide a list of the datasets you’ve published. Good ones will include additional information about that dataset (this is known as the metadata). Simplistic catalog offerings, however, can;t display the information from multiple datasets without additional visualisation modules that need to be manually configured to display information from disparate datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By choosing identifiers when you upload data to DataDock, you can upload additional information that pertains to those records later on, and your data portal will automatically group that information together for display in the data portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best explained in a walk-through of connecting up three datasets I added to my own data portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selecting-the-data&quot;&gt;Selecting the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I went on the hunt for some open data that would be useful to show this functionality. I found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/Land-Use/Bristol-Monuments/nyj9-igak&quot;&gt;interesting dataset detailing archaeological / historic structures&lt;/a&gt; on the Bristol City Council’s beta open data platform. It’s published under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode&quot;&gt;public domain (CC-0) license&lt;/a&gt; meaning I have the right to reproduce it elsewhere. The dataset was available in CSV (comma separated value) format and most importantly it also included a &lt;strong&gt;Monument Record Number&lt;/strong&gt; that I quickly checked that there were no duplicates or missing values - perfect for use as the DataDock identifier for each record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the data preview of the Bristol Monuments data&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uploading-to-datadock&quot;&gt;Uploading to DataDock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, DataDock produces identifiers for each of the records in your spreadsheet using the row number, but to be able to add extra information in the future, we want an identifier that will work across datasets. As mentioned above, I’d seen that the &lt;code&gt;MONUMENT_RECORD_NO&lt;/code&gt; suited an identifier and so I selected this from the drop-down list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_identifiers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting the identifier&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viewing-the-data&quot;&gt;Viewing the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the import job was completed, I can use the buttons on my dashboard to view my data portal, and dive into the data using the &lt;code&gt;exampleResource&lt;/code&gt; links. See how the fact I selected the Monument Record Number has affected the addresses of the records in the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://datadock.io/jennet/odcamp-demo/id/resource/&lt;strong&gt;monument_record_no&lt;/strong&gt;/1054M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating to this record in a web browser shows us all the information pertaining to that record. This is known as the “resource page” for a particular record in your dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page for a single record from the dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merging-data-from-a-different-dataset&quot;&gt;Merging data from a different dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a second spreadsheet that contained the specific latitude and longitude of each monument, along with the monument record number of course. I wanted to add this data as the original data only listed the location as a combined field of (lat, long). 
 During the upload of the second spreadsheet I again selected the &lt;code&gt;MONUMENT_RECORD_NO&lt;/code&gt; as my DataDock identifier. Once the import job had completed I can refresh the resource page and see that my additional data from the separate dataset is shown on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page now showing additional data from the second dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots---linking-in&quot;&gt;Connecting the dots - linking in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use those same identifiers to link &lt;strong&gt;into&lt;/strong&gt; the resources that we’ve published through other datasets. To demonstrate this I wrote a dummy survey report noting “damage” to the monuments. In the survey data we use the addresses of the monument resources instead of their number or name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/dummy_damage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dummy damage report&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I choose the damage report ID as my identifier, and upload the dataset for conversion and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-catalog&quot;&gt;Data catalog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process this has also meant that each dataset has been added to the dataset catalog on my data portal landing page. The data catalog lists each of my datasets along with any other information I added during upload, such as the license, a title, description, and keyword tags. It also shows the data download links for the complete dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/data_catalog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data catalog lisr&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more interesting is how the data from these separate datasets can appear in a single web resource through the use of identifiers and we can see how even data that points &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the resource can be shown on that resource page too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource3.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page now showing incoming links from the third dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve found this simple walkthrough helpful in demonstrating the benefits of being able to connect your data. We’re able to explore data in a way that goes beyond the boundaries of each separate dataset or spreadsheet is their source. Identifiers are the key concept in this way of thinking about connecting data.

        <title>Introducing DataDock</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to publish some data, what do you do next? As we’ve mentioned before, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/08/10/opening-up-your-data.html&quot;&gt;publishing data shouldn’t cost the earth&lt;/a&gt;, but that there are some technical challenges to be faced when we want that data to be discoverable, accessible and usable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, technical challenges mean resource challenges; even when data publishing software is free or open-source, it can mean that you require someone with the technical know-how to set it all up (and keep it running), and the resources to run the server to hold the software. In so many cases, these technical and resource challenges basically block individuals and smaller organisations from being able to publish data effectively or at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that taking your first steps in publishing your data shouldn’t be this hard. We have the technical skills and expertise in data publishing standards to be able to provide that publishing service in a way that eliminates those barriers. Over the last few months we’ve been building the answer to those challenges, and we’ve called it DataDock. We’ve now &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;released it as a preview edition&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it’s ready to be used by the open data community, and that we’ll be collecting feedback while we work on some additional features over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-deep-dive-data-portal-in-a-matter-of-minutes&quot;&gt;Have a deep-dive data portal in a matter of minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your spreadsheet, select a license, then let DataDock do all the magic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That magic provides you with a data portal home page, which lists a dataset for each of your spreadsheets. The data portal shows useful information about each dataset and clear licensing information, along with links to download the original spreadsheet and the data in other formats. You can also click into the dataset itself, as DataDock creates pages for every record in your data, allowing you to deep-dive into your published data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-worry-about-the-techno-babble&quot;&gt;Don’t worry about the techno-babble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our main aims is to try and eliminate as much as possible all the jargon and techno-babble surrounding data publishing. DataDock handles the magic, freeing you up to concentrate on the data itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-hold-of-your-data&quot;&gt;Keep hold of your data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the standards-compliant data produced by DataDock is published to your GitHub account. You can turn off DataDock’s access any time you wish, and keep all the data it produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-based&quot;&gt;Cloud-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to buy web-hosting, DataDock sits in the cloud and we will always provide free accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got hundreds of ideas for enhancements and features for DataDock, and we’d like to work on the things you want most. Get involved on by requesting features or up-voting existing requests on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NetworkedPlanet/datadock/issues&quot;&gt;DataDock support site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-for-the-geeks-too&quot;&gt;It’s for the geeks too&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t want to bore you with that right now. Standards geeks and linked data nerds will be interested in reading the follow ups to this blog post to learn more about the CSVW and 5-star linked data standards that are at the core of DataDock’s internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in having a play around, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;DataDock.io&lt;/a&gt; and check it out. We’d love to hear from you about what you’d like it to do in the future. Upgrades to DataDock won’t effect the data you’ve published, they’ll simply add features to your future uploads, so feel free to get stuck in even at this preview stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/DataDock_ColourTrans.png&quot; alt=&quot;DataDock logo&quot; height=&quot;149px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Co-operative Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, a confession: I went along to Open:2017 without a very clear idea about what a platform co-operative really was. I had been asked to get involved due to my work relating to Linked Data, and whilst I had read up a little bit on platform co-ops I only really had a vague idea that it was “sort of like doing something like AirBnB or Uber but without exploiting those using the platform”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came away not only with a clearer idea of what a platform co-op is (I’ll get into that in a minute), but also with a real hunger for finding a way of adopting this approach in future projects. So what is this approach? Most people are aware of co-operatives - where groups of people have come together to form an entity to manage something like a building or buildings to live in (housing co-ops), a business (worker co-ops) or a food shop or cafe (consumer co-ops), amongst other things. What they all have in common is the drive to create entities where the people who take part in that co-op can become members who actively participate (if they wish) in the running of the co-op itself. Any profits are then shared amongst the members and/or ploughed back into the co-op itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With platform co-operatives, instead of members coming together around a physical building or a business that’s usually fairly localised, the “hub” is a digital platform. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stocksy.com/&quot;&gt;Stocksy&lt;/a&gt; is a stock photography platform that’s owned and run by all of their photographers. I must admit I still get a bit confused as to why they went with “platform co-operative” rather than “digital co-operative”, but then again I also complain that calling things “digital” isn’t specific enough, so I admit I’m difficult to please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than me continue to badly explain co-operatives and platform co-ops, here’s a few links to read up some more if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uk.coop/about/about-co-operatives-uk&quot;&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the conference, the first session I took part in was a panel with Tim Davies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendataservices.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Data Services Co-op&lt;/a&gt;) and Karin Christiansen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge Foundation&lt;/a&gt;) called “From data slaves to data citizens”. The session was intended to be a discussion around open data, but ended up being primarily about user’s fear of the intentions and uses of data collected by platforms that had become so monolithic that it was difficult to have a digital presence without signing up to their services. The second session I was helping to present focused on content from Matt Wallis from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/&quot;&gt;Institute of Solidarity Economics&lt;/a&gt; who have adopted a Linked Data focused approach to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/our-work/internal-projects/&quot;&gt;data infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. I was really pleased to see that a large proportion of the attendees were comfortable with Linked Data already. My gut feeling is that in this environment filled with people working with such commitment to collaboration and information sharing, Linked Data is obviously not new to them, as it provides the standard for collaborating effectively at a data management and sharing level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session I was directly involved with was “Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem”, a lengthy 2 hour workshop session led by Laura Hilliger, Enric Senebre Hidalgo and Ricard Espelt. They did a great job facilitating the structure, creating smaller discussion groups over particular topics brainstormed at the start of the session. The discussion continues over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;discuss.open.coop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A pitch idea bubbling for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODcamp&quot;&gt;@ODcamp&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/opencoop?src=hash&quot;&gt;#opencoop&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;how can platform co-ops benefit the open data ecosystem?&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/crosspollination?src=hash&quot;&gt;#crosspollination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Networked Planet (@nwplanet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nwplanet/status/832970665565224960&quot;&gt;February 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what next? Well, my mind is buzzing about all sort of things. From the interoperable apps session, I’d love to hear about people pushing forward with publishing open data vocabularies for use in linked data publishing. Oli from Open Co-op is hoping to rekindle the Collaborative Technology Alliance’s efforts (more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m interested to see if linked data plays a part in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically about platform co-ops, I’m wondering if our new cloud service that goes live in alpha/preview mode this weekend would be suitable for a platform co-operative, and what the logistics of that would be. The value systems certainly align, but would the administrative needs fit? I don’t know yet but I’m going to continue to delve deeper to answer my questions around that. In a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; timely blog post from the ODI, Tom Sasse asks the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://theodi.org/news/how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation&quot;&gt;“How can open data portals become sustainable?”&lt;/a&gt; - perhaps platform co-operatives hold the answer. I’m hoping others may want to discuss this sort of thing with me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;ODCamp&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, so expect a pitch from me around this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I’ve come away from Open:2017 with a lot of questions buzzing around my head, but also a real sense of purpose and positivity. I’d really like to spread the word about the people who attended and their projects and platforms, however I don’t currently have a full list, as a starting point here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/open_coop/lists/open-2017-contributors/members&quot;&gt;twitter list of contributors to the conference&lt;/a&gt; (those involved in panels and presenting sessions). If you were at the conference please feel free to add details and pointers to your work in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there’s an Open:2018, it was a fantastic event. Keep an eye on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Co-op&lt;/a&gt; do next!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open 2017 Platform Co-operatives</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By providing a viable alternative to the standard internet business model based on monopoly and extraction, platform cooperatives provide a template for a new type of organisation – forming the building blocks for a new economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much looking forward to Open:2017 which is being held tomorrow and Friday at Goldsmiths in South London. The subjects of the various sessions looks so interesting I think I’ll find it difficult to choose what to attend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on a few of the panels, so at least I know a few of the subjects that I’ll get to participate in discussions about. I was very happy to hear from the organisers that they are fighting hard to avoid “Death By Powerpoint”, so expect panels and discussions and audience discussion instead of a single person droning on at you for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sessions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-data-slaves-to-data-citizens&quot;&gt;From data slaves to data citizens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday 4:15pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linked-open-data-for-the-solidarity-economy&quot;&gt;Linked open data for the solidarity economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday 11:20am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-session-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Working session: Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday 2pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.coop/2016/12/02/introduction-platform-co-ops/&quot;&gt;this blogpost introducing the concept of platform cooperatives&lt;/a&gt; is a great starting point, and you can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.open.coop/programme/&quot;&gt;full programme here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I see co-producers and stakeholders... everywhere.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blogpost was originally posted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://e-voice.org.uk/twadata/blog/one-entry?entry_id=28325666&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead - Data Theme blog&lt;/a&gt; and is republished here in full&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our last meeting, Kate and I have been travelling to meetings and events around London. We have much more to do, but we want to update you on the stakeholders/co-producers with which we have engaged and who we hope to engage much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From volunteer sector leaders we learned that funding is often given by charitable people or groups which are not listed as organisations.  We have been asked to try to find ways to include data about these funders, which is seen as a challenge by all, but may become a great project for our data collection and sharing entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have put our vision of the ‘hub’ into a sort of paused-for-additional information state, as we’ve found other organisations which are working toward very similar goals.  These include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/london-office-data-analytics-pilot-now-hard-part&quot;&gt;London Boroughs’ Data Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-office-of-data-analytics&quot;&gt;London Office of Data Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to speak with the parties involved in leading these efforts soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made contact with local academia, at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/&quot;&gt;EPPI-Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and they agree that collaborating makes good sense. Tentatively, in addition to providing links to systematic reviews for use by organisations, we hope to include some brief and helpful tutorials on how to search for and find the right research for whatever project for which one works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have met with the GLA and the London Council, who have helped us identify several needs related to information sharing within the various government offices across the city. They have both been eager to help and be part of collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still want to meet with the engagement officers of as many CCGs as possible, Ipsos Mori (or similar), education data users and providers, and we are reaching out to various communities through a request to the EU National Institutes for Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will update again! Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;well text-center&quot;&gt;More &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tags/the-way-ahead/&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/a&gt; articles&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Data Camp 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks to go! &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/announcing-open-data-camp-4/&quot;&gt;Open Data Camp numero 4&lt;/a&gt; is being held at the Pierhead in Cardiff on the Saturday and Sunday, 25-26th of February. ODCamp instantly became my favourite data focused event after I attended the second ODCamp in Manchester and then helped bring it to Bristol for ODCamp3. You can read my &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;other blog posts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to dive deep into my ODCamp journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since volunteering with the ODCamp organising committee for the Bristol event, I was invited to remain on the organising team to help make future ODCamps happen. I was more than happy to accept and am really delighted to be part of a team made up of such friendly, proactive humans. NetworkedPlanet were proud to be one of the key sponsors of ODCamp3 in Bristol, and remain committed to sponsoring ODCamp4 and future events as we are so impressed with the team’s ability to foster an environment that nurtures forward-thinking ideas and debate surrounding production and consumption of open data in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough of my gushing about the people who run and attend ODCamps - if you’ve not been to one then here’s a quick run down…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ODCamp is a free &lt;strong&gt;un-&lt;/strong&gt;conference. Unconferences are a particular format of event that doesn’t pre-plan a programme of sessions. Instead, session ideas are “pitched” by the attendees at the start of the day and then, using a show of hands to judge size of space required, pens, and sticky notes, the volunteer crew (called “camp-makers” at ODCamp) create the programme for the day. ODCamp covers costs by offering various sponsorship levels, &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/sponsors-feb-2017/&quot;&gt;the list of sponsors helping make ODCamp4 happen is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_sessionboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Creating the  session schedule&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my first ODCamp I didn’t plan on pitching a session, but over the course of the first day and chats in the evening afterwards, I realised that a small session on converting CSV data formats to RDF linked data formats might be useful to a few people. I pitched it on the Sunday morning, and that afternoon ran a small workshop messing about with Open Refine to show people how you get from CSV to RDF as basically a “demystifying RDF” workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of ODCamp massively appeals to me because the content is so obviously influenced by the attendees. The organising team have a really good balance of hands-on when it comes to keeping the event flowing and dealing with all the logistics, whilst staying more hands-off to allow the content and discussions to grow organically. Sessions might be round-circle discussions, presentations about tools or projects, building and making of new projects, all kinds of things! You don’t have to pitch a session based on your own subject-knowledge, sessions can be pitched around a question or topic that you want to know more about, and the “pitch” becomes a shout out for other attendees with more knowledge in that area to share in a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_breakoutspaces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Break out spaces&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing is to choose which sessions to go to, you will undoubtedly have 2 or more sessions that you want to attend at the same time. Luckily ODCamp encourages people to move between sessions instead of feeling they must remain for the entirety of one, and this way you can dip in to more than one interesting session (a top tip is to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/odcamp?src=hash&quot;&gt;live-tweeting&lt;/a&gt; from attendees in other sessions). Some sessions also get covered by the amazing talents at &lt;a href=&quot;https://drawnalism.com/&quot;&gt;Drawnalism&lt;/a&gt;, who live-draw infographics of key points from session content, which are then tacked up around the main room for all to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_livedrawing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Live drawing capture the key points from sessions&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ODCamp releases the free tickets in batches, and each batch “sells out” in a matter of minutes. Those who are unable to attend are &lt;strong&gt;strongly encouraged&lt;/strong&gt; to update their registration so that others can make it in their place. ODCamp4 is already at full capacity but there may well be extra releases if there have been any cancellations, so set your twitter feed to give you notifications from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODcamp&quot;&gt;@ODCamp&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve not already secured a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already got a ticket then I’ll see you there, if you miss out this time, ODCamp5 will be along before you know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_finalsession.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Data Camp - Bristol&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Way Ahead for London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t run.  I am going to write a frightening word, but we can face it together: Co-production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I did it. As an impact evaluator, I often have to help clients find ways to really co-produce data and evaluations, and it is not, often, something that happens without some failures. This can be frightening, because time is always of the essence and because funders want co-production (even when they don’t do it very well).  It is proven to be transformative, though.  It is worth doing and doing well, and it is worth learning from failure at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am endeavouring to practice the things I preach as I work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lvsc.org.uk/future-of-civil-society-support-in-london-latest-update/work-with-us-to-achieve-the-ambitions-of-the-way-ahead-for-londoners.aspx&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.  The project seeks to build an infrastructure to help Civil Society organisations, which is as co-produced as possible.  I am only working on the data sharing aspects, but studies have shown that open databases for civil society, which are co-produced, are more used and (assumably) more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of work to do.  London is a large and very diverse community.  We are going to have to pull our sleeves up and hit the streets, call all partners, think outside the box, and continually look at our stats to see if we are making any headway.  We will also be able to gather information about various communities from digital resources, and we can use scholarship about populations, as well.  The work requires real care, because simply having someone who identifies with a certain group, does not equal having a representative of the group.  We can gather insights from individuals, and then investigate those insights, true, but that is not co-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-production is a process and a product by which we provide an ongoing method for various stakeholders to be involved in, and provide insight to, research.  The work of co-production often begins by identifying many different stakeholder groups and then finding out how to introduce your project, exhibit listening, and repeat. With each iteration, we gain some insight. Sometimes the new insight is from failure. Such is the nature of learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I am part of a large minority in London, an immigrant from America. There are more than 60,000 of us living in London.  Never assume that any opinion I have is anything like any other American, or even like other Americans in London. You will probably be very wrong. No one person can actually speak for large and diverse populations.  BUT, if I tell you that I don’t want to come to your meeting about the data sharing project because I think it is only for people who were born in Britain and have a British accent, then: you have some insight worth investigating.  Are non-UK born people not attending the events because of this perception? Something else? Or is it many things?  By letting other non-UK-born persons know that you have heard the voice of one, you might encourage others to speak up, and then, you may find barriers that inhibit many from a group with a particular situation. (Maybe I am the only one who is intimidated by British accents.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is wonderful and fascinating work, co-producing, and I’ll keep you updated about our strategies and success or failure, here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I sent out various notices about the meeting in other languages, and I began looking for non-English language radio.  I got a warm reception, which is a good start.  We shall see how it goes.  We’ll also be reaching out to different age groups (and diverse different age groups!), of course, and monitoring involvement by diverse people of various levels of education.  It takes a whole range of people to get this right.  If you want to help, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;be in touch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
