        <title>Co-operative Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, a confession: I went along to Open:2017 without a very clear idea about what a platform co-operative really was. I had been asked to get involved due to my work relating to Linked Data, and whilst I had read up a little bit on platform co-ops I only really had a vague idea that it was “sort of like doing something like AirBnB or Uber but without exploiting those using the platform”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came away not only with a clearer idea of what a platform co-op is (I’ll get into that in a minute), but also with a real hunger for finding a way of adopting this approach in future projects. So what is this approach? Most people are aware of co-operatives - where groups of people have come together to form an entity to manage something like a building or buildings to live in (housing co-ops), a business (worker co-ops) or a food shop or cafe (consumer co-ops), amongst other things. What they all have in common is the drive to create entities where the people who take part in that co-op can become members who actively participate (if they wish) in the running of the co-op itself. Any profits are then shared amongst the members and/or ploughed back into the co-op itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With platform co-operatives, instead of members coming together around a physical building or a business that’s usually fairly localised, the “hub” is a digital platform. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stocksy.com/&quot;&gt;Stocksy&lt;/a&gt; is a stock photography platform that’s owned and run by all of their photographers. I must admit I still get a bit confused as to why they went with “platform co-operative” rather than “digital co-operative”, but then again I also complain that calling things “digital” isn’t specific enough, so I admit I’m difficult to please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than me continue to badly explain co-operatives and platform co-ops, here’s a few links to read up some more if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the conference, the first session I took part in was a panel with Tim Davies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendataservices.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Data Services Co-op&lt;/a&gt;) and Karin Christiansen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge Foundation&lt;/a&gt;) called “From data slaves to data citizens”. The session was intended to be a discussion around open data, but ended up being primarily about user’s fear of the intentions and uses of data collected by platforms that had become so monolithic that it was difficult to have a digital presence without signing up to their services. The second session I was helping to present focused on content from Matt Wallis from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/&quot;&gt;Institute of Solidarity Economics&lt;/a&gt; who have adopted a Linked Data focused approach to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/our-work/internal-projects/&quot;&gt;data infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. I was really pleased to see that a large proportion of the attendees were comfortable with Linked Data already. My gut feeling is that in this environment filled with people working with such commitment to collaboration and information sharing, Linked Data is obviously not new to them, as it provides the standard for collaborating effectively at a data management and sharing level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session I was directly involved with was “Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem”, a lengthy 2 hour workshop session led by Laura Hilliger, Enric Senebre Hidalgo and Ricard Espelt. They did a great job facilitating the structure, creating smaller discussion groups over particular topics brainstormed at the start of the session. The discussion continues over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;discuss.open.coop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A pitch idea bubbling for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODcamp&quot;&gt;@ODcamp&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/opencoop?src=hash&quot;&gt;#opencoop&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;how can platform co-ops benefit the open data ecosystem?&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/crosspollination?src=hash&quot;&gt;#crosspollination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Networked Planet (@nwplanet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nwplanet/status/832970665565224960&quot;&gt;February 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what next? Well, my mind is buzzing about all sort of things. From the interoperable apps session, I’d love to hear about people pushing forward with publishing open data vocabularies for use in linked data publishing. Oli from Open Co-op is hoping to rekindle the Collaborative Technology Alliance’s efforts (more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m interested to see if linked data plays a part in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically about platform co-ops, I’m wondering if our new cloud service that goes live in alpha/preview mode this weekend would be suitable for a platform co-operative, and what the logistics of that would be. The value systems certainly align, but would the administrative needs fit? I don’t know yet but I’m going to continue to delve deeper to answer my questions around that. In a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; timely blog post from the ODI, Tom Sasse asks the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://theodi.org/news/how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation&quot;&gt;“How can open data portals become sustainable?”&lt;/a&gt; - perhaps platform co-operatives hold the answer. I’m hoping others may want to discuss this sort of thing with me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;ODCamp&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, so expect a pitch from me around this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I’ve come away from Open:2017 with a lot of questions buzzing around my head, but also a real sense of purpose and positivity. I’d really like to spread the word about the people who attended and their projects and platforms, however I don’t currently have a full list, as a starting point here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/open_coop/lists/open-2017-contributors/members&quot;&gt;twitter list of contributors to the conference&lt;/a&gt; (those involved in panels and presenting sessions). If you were at the conference please feel free to add details and pointers to your work in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there’s an Open:2018, it was a fantastic event. Keep an eye on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Co-op&lt;/a&gt; do next!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open 2017 Platform Co-operatives</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By providing a viable alternative to the standard internet business model based on monopoly and extraction, platform cooperatives provide a template for a new type of organisation – forming the building blocks for a new economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much looking forward to Open:2017 which is being held tomorrow and Friday at Goldsmiths in South London. The subjects of the various sessions looks so interesting I think I’ll find it difficult to choose what to attend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on a few of the panels, so at least I know a few of the subjects that I’ll get to participate in discussions about. I was very happy to hear from the organisers that they are fighting hard to avoid “Death By Powerpoint”, so expect panels and discussions and audience discussion instead of a single person droning on at you for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sessions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-data-slaves-to-data-citizens&quot;&gt;From data slaves to data citizens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday 4:15pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linked-open-data-for-the-solidarity-economy&quot;&gt;Linked open data for the solidarity economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday 11:20am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-session-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Working session: Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday 2pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.coop/2016/12/02/introduction-platform-co-ops/&quot;&gt;this blogpost introducing the concept of platform cooperatives&lt;/a&gt; is a great starting point, and you can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.open.coop/programme/&quot;&gt;full programme here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I see co-producers and stakeholders... everywhere.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blogpost was originally posted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://e-voice.org.uk/twadata/blog/one-entry?entry_id=28325666&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead - Data Theme blog&lt;/a&gt; and is republished here in full&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our last meeting, Kate and I have been travelling to meetings and events around London. We have much more to do, but we want to update you on the stakeholders/co-producers with which we have engaged and who we hope to engage much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From volunteer sector leaders we learned that funding is often given by charitable people or groups which are not listed as organisations.  We have been asked to try to find ways to include data about these funders, which is seen as a challenge by all, but may become a great project for our data collection and sharing entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have put our vision of the ‘hub’ into a sort of paused-for-additional information state, as we’ve found other organisations which are working toward very similar goals.  These include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/london-office-data-analytics-pilot-now-hard-part&quot;&gt;London Boroughs’ Data Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-office-of-data-analytics&quot;&gt;London Office of Data Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to speak with the parties involved in leading these efforts soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made contact with local academia, at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/&quot;&gt;EPPI-Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and they agree that collaborating makes good sense. Tentatively, in addition to providing links to systematic reviews for use by organisations, we hope to include some brief and helpful tutorials on how to search for and find the right research for whatever project for which one works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have met with the GLA and the London Council, who have helped us identify several needs related to information sharing within the various government offices across the city. They have both been eager to help and be part of collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still want to meet with the engagement officers of as many CCGs as possible, Ipsos Mori (or similar), education data users and providers, and we are reaching out to various communities through a request to the EU National Institutes for Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will update again! Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Data Camp 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks to go! &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/announcing-open-data-camp-4/&quot;&gt;Open Data Camp numero 4&lt;/a&gt; is being held at the Pierhead in Cardiff on the Saturday and Sunday, 25-26th of February. ODCamp instantly became my favourite data focused event after I attended the second ODCamp in Manchester and then helped bring it to Bristol for ODCamp3. You can read my &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;other blog posts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to dive deep into my ODCamp journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since volunteering with the ODCamp organising committee for the Bristol event, I was invited to remain on the organising team to help make future ODCamps happen. I was more than happy to accept and am really delighted to be part of a team made up of such friendly, proactive humans. NetworkedPlanet were proud to be one of the key sponsors of ODCamp3 in Bristol, and remain committed to sponsoring ODCamp4 and future events as we are so impressed with the team’s ability to foster an environment that nurtures forward-thinking ideas and debate surrounding production and consumption of open data in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough of my gushing about the people who run and attend ODCamps - if you’ve not been to one then here’s a quick run down…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ODCamp is a free &lt;strong&gt;un-&lt;/strong&gt;conference. Unconferences are a particular format of event that doesn’t pre-plan a programme of sessions. Instead, session ideas are “pitched” by the attendees at the start of the day and then, using a show of hands to judge size of space required, pens, and sticky notes, the volunteer crew (called “camp-makers” at ODCamp) create the programme for the day. ODCamp covers costs by offering various sponsorship levels, &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/sponsors-feb-2017/&quot;&gt;the list of sponsors helping make ODCamp4 happen is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_sessionboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Creating the  session schedule&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my first ODCamp I didn’t plan on pitching a session, but over the course of the first day and chats in the evening afterwards, I realised that a small session on converting CSV data formats to RDF linked data formats might be useful to a few people. I pitched it on the Sunday morning, and that afternoon ran a small workshop messing about with Open Refine to show people how you get from CSV to RDF as basically a “demystifying RDF” workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of ODCamp massively appeals to me because the content is so obviously influenced by the attendees. The organising team have a really good balance of hands-on when it comes to keeping the event flowing and dealing with all the logistics, whilst staying more hands-off to allow the content and discussions to grow organically. Sessions might be round-circle discussions, presentations about tools or projects, building and making of new projects, all kinds of things! You don’t have to pitch a session based on your own subject-knowledge, sessions can be pitched around a question or topic that you want to know more about, and the “pitch” becomes a shout out for other attendees with more knowledge in that area to share in a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_breakoutspaces.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Break out spaces&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing is to choose which sessions to go to, you will undoubtedly have 2 or more sessions that you want to attend at the same time. Luckily ODCamp encourages people to move between sessions instead of feeling they must remain for the entirety of one, and this way you can dip in to more than one interesting session (a top tip is to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/odcamp?src=hash&quot;&gt;live-tweeting&lt;/a&gt; from attendees in other sessions). Some sessions also get covered by the amazing talents at &lt;a href=&quot;https://drawnalism.com/&quot;&gt;Drawnalism&lt;/a&gt;, who live-draw infographics of key points from session content, which are then tacked up around the main room for all to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/odcamp4/odc3_livedrawing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Live drawing capture the key points from sessions&quot; height=&quot;426px&quot; width=&quot;640px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ODCamp releases the free tickets in batches, and each batch “sells out” in a matter of minutes. Those who are unable to attend are &lt;strong&gt;strongly encouraged&lt;/strong&gt; to update their registration so that others can make it in their place. ODCamp4 is already at full capacity but there may well be extra releases if there have been any cancellations, so set your twitter feed to give you notifications from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODcamp&quot;&gt;@ODCamp&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve not already secured a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already got a ticket then I’ll see you there, if you miss out this time, ODCamp5 will be along before you know it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Way Ahead for London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t run.  I am going to write a frightening word, but we can face it together: Co-production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I did it. As an impact evaluator, I often have to help clients find ways to really co-produce data and evaluations, and it is not, often, something that happens without some failures. This can be frightening, because time is always of the essence and because funders want co-production (even when they don’t do it very well).  It is proven to be transformative, though.  It is worth doing and doing well, and it is worth learning from failure at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am endeavouring to practice the things I preach as I work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lvsc.org.uk/future-of-civil-society-support-in-london-latest-update/work-with-us-to-achieve-the-ambitions-of-the-way-ahead-for-londoners.aspx&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.  The project seeks to build an infrastructure to help Civil Society organisations, which is as co-produced as possible.  I am only working on the data sharing aspects, but studies have shown that open databases for civil society, which are co-produced, are more used and (assumably) more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of work to do.  London is a large and very diverse community.  We are going to have to pull our sleeves up and hit the streets, call all partners, think outside the box, and continually look at our stats to see if we are making any headway.  We will also be able to gather information about various communities from digital resources, and we can use scholarship about populations, as well.  The work requires real care, because simply having someone who identifies with a certain group, does not equal having a representative of the group.  We can gather insights from individuals, and then investigate those insights, true, but that is not co-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-production is a process and a product by which we provide an ongoing method for various stakeholders to be involved in, and provide insight to, research.  The work of co-production often begins by identifying many different stakeholder groups and then finding out how to introduce your project, exhibit listening, and repeat. With each iteration, we gain some insight. Sometimes the new insight is from failure. Such is the nature of learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I am part of a large minority in London, an immigrant from America. There are more than 60,000 of us living in London.  Never assume that any opinion I have is anything like any other American, or even like other Americans in London. You will probably be very wrong. No one person can actually speak for large and diverse populations.  BUT, if I tell you that I don’t want to come to your meeting about the data sharing project because I think it is only for people who were born in Britain and have a British accent, then: you have some insight worth investigating.  Are non-UK born people not attending the events because of this perception? Something else? Or is it many things?  By letting other non-UK-born persons know that you have heard the voice of one, you might encourage others to speak up, and then, you may find barriers that inhibit many from a group with a particular situation. (Maybe I am the only one who is intimidated by British accents.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is wonderful and fascinating work, co-producing, and I’ll keep you updated about our strategies and success or failure, here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I sent out various notices about the meeting in other languages, and I began looking for non-English language radio.  I got a warm reception, which is a good start.  We shall see how it goes.  We’ll also be reaching out to different age groups (and diverse different age groups!), of course, and monitoring involvement by diverse people of various levels of education.  It takes a whole range of people to get this right.  If you want to help, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;be in touch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Keys to a Successful Data Strategy for Charities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This one hour presentation by Lea is aimed at board members, directors, managers and leaders 
of charities, non-profits and social enterprises. Starting with the challenges that these 
organisations face around the collection, processing and use of data; the presentation 
describes the key ways in which leaders can effectively define and implement a data strategy 
and promote evidence informed decision making within their organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key Data Innovations to Ensure Your Organisation Survives and Thrives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Charity leaders will learn about data protection and how to lead organisations toward better collection and use of data at our workshop at the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in London on the 10th of November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will review and explore data protection and privacy laws to gain a comfort level that allows participants to lead, wisely, onward, before we delve into new priorities for data collection and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a true workshop, allowing participants to gain a solid footing on issues that often result in wasted time and energy at charities. The goal is to equip leaders to empower their staff toward the big goals of the organisation - making major gains in efforts to create a better world.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring the Impact of Open Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was happy to find widespread agreement about our ideas for the need to measure impact of open data policies, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatacon.org/&quot;&gt;International Open Data Conference&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that we can better guide organisations into a proper data stewardship plan, if we have some way of valuing the various parts of the plan.  I know, some of you are thinking that this will rain on the parade, but measuring the impact of open data policies will not be uneventful.  Wandering into this new field of impact and benefit analysis will be full of excitement and surprises.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first evaluations will begin to answer questions about what is already valuable and what indicators are helpful for determining the value of an open data set.  We won’t be alone in the conversation, and the field won’t stop growing and developing.  Studying the value, though, will help organisations make better decisions and invest more meaningfully in sharing data and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this? Use the comments section below for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Partners Sought in Data-for-Good Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-a-new-series-of-tools-to-help-find-the-solutions-to-the-worlds-problems&quot;&gt;Launching a new series of tools to help find the solutions to the world’s problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;announcement-partners-sought-in-data-for-good-project&quot;&gt;Announcement: Partners Sought in Data-for-Good Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, NetworkedPlanet has turned a corner. Our company has long managed data, and we are among the vanguard in managing open-linked data, globally.  The world of big data focuses largely on for-profit and consumer insights. We, however, are turning our sights to social problems and the organisations who want to use data-for-good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to join us?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for organisations that seek to solve a social, health, or environmental problem, and understand that more data can lead to innovation and insights.  We intend to design bespoke systems to use linkable data from various locations and sectors to provide the cause with a powerful new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in projects that aim to: relieve suffering; improves the health of the environment; or address disease.  We are especially interested in projects that have more than one sector of interest in terms of data (for example, environmental data and health data, or law enforcement and social data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will review letters of interest in early November and meet with prospective partners in late November (2016). Meetings may be held via Goto Meeting, if you are based outside of the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be considered, please send a short letter explaining the interests of your organisation, and providing contact details, to: Lea@networkedplanet.com before 29 October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buscamos a las organizaciones que tratan de resolver un problema del ambiente, de la salud, o la sociedad, y la organización entienden que un mayor número de datos pueden conducir a la innovación y las ideas. Tenemos la intención de diseñar sistemas a medida para utilizar los datos vinculables de varios lugares y sectores para proporcionar la causa con una nueva y poderosa herramienta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estamos interesados ​​en proyectos que tienen como objetivo: aliviar el sufrimiento; mejora la salud del medio ambiente; o tratar la enfermedad. Estamos especialmente interesados ​​en proyectos que tengan más de un sector de interés en términos de datos (por ejemplo, los datos ambientales y de salud, o por la policía y los datos sociales). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vamos a revisar las cartas de interés a principios de noviembre y se reunirá con los posibles socios a finales de noviembre (2016). Las reuniones podrán ocurer mediante ‘GOTO meeting’ si se basan fuera del Reino Unido. &lt;/p&gt;
