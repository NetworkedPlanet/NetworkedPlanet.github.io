        <title>Flipping The Data Hierarchy - Disrupting the Charity and Academic Sectors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet&lt;/a&gt; seeks to alleviate suffering in the world by helping find solutions to persistent problems with sensible open and linked data and technology. We are confident that charities and others can succeed better and find new insights in high quality, shared datasets. We know that good datasets can be much more useful when open and discoverable by others and/or at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the best open datasets, studies show that stakeholder involvement is key, and it has always been at the heart of what we do. I have written a few pieces on the nature of stakeholder involvement. Today, I want to explain the vision of the future with a web of data that is built by stakeholders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/data/&quot;&gt;web of useful data&lt;/a&gt; will disrupt the current structures of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/third_sector&quot;&gt;third sector&lt;/a&gt;, charities, government, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines&quot;&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt;, because stakeholders will not be paid simple lip-service, but will drive research and data collection. It is a cultural change that has been developing slowly, and many important factors are now in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/&quot;&gt;world of better educated people&lt;/a&gt;, which we now have, it is not necessary to shield good data from the public&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Further, due to the changes in the methods of production and education, many people are (and will increasingly be) highly skilled in data science, numeracy, and technology. Numerous studies have already found that involving stakeholders in research improves the quality of the research, and the same appears to be true for the quality of data sets and open data.  As the saying goes, “Two (hundred) heads is better than one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/disrupt/planet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic of linked icons connected around the earth&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this enlightened new world, academic researchers and statisticians will be asked to interact with data that is collected from a different perspective. Academic funding (and therefore careers) will depend on interactions with the stakeholder data collaboratives, rather than only interactions with other academics, because academic journals and research funders will demand proof of stakeholder involvement and open data. The growing openness of research and research data means that social workers and programme delivery staff at charities will be (are) empowered to understand more fully the reasoning of policies, procedures, and programme delivery. Analysts and service delivery personnel of government are already finding that, in order to keep up, they must work together with the data-hungry public&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. There is some promise that these change will push political agendas to the margins of day-to-day governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can see how the core practices in social work and academia will change. Hierarchies will be (are being) disrupted. Large scale production and usage of open and linked data to solve social problems requires dramatic inclusion and agility. The pace of change will (is), no doubt, cause (causing) pain points. (We may be feeling these in the tight elections and shifting journalistic landscape of today.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a different hierarchy that focuses on being evidence-based in designing programmes and interventions. Social scientists, statisticians, and data scientists, will work for social workers to design programmes that remedy social ills and leave communities with a need to teach about the history of suffering (because most will not be subject to it). There might even be interventions planned for highly privileged groups, who are shown to lack knowledge of how one’s “first world choices” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, many social programmes are the result of various practices - some scientific, and some purely theoretical (or political). Too often, management fails to put faith in social science and research and relies only on political jargon and a fleeting understanding of the causes and cures to socially caused suffering. Adhering to a dogma, rather than knowing that society is always changing and constantly gathering evidence to measure what has changed, can make staff afraid to question the data, and suffocate innovation. Programme staff may see their role as only a repetitive function -serving the same victims of the same perpetrators, and not stopping to ask questions that lead to finding solutions. For example: a few weeks ago, a young woman who works for a domestic violence charity in fundraising was aghast when I suggested that we could try to work with survivors of domestic abuse to design a data strategy to end &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence#dv&quot;&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;. She said something really troubling to me (as a professional who has worked to end domestic violence for more than 20 years). She said, “We can’t do it. We can never end domestic violence. It will always exist.”  I was stunned into absolute silence. I had assumed that young people in the field had knowledge of all the progress we’ve made as we have studied and tested interventions and studied and reiterated, ect… The international movement to end domestic violence has ended a great deal of domestic violence, in many contexts. A lot of women and children survived because of evidence based policy changes. There is no reason to think (I believe) that we can’t really wipe it out, but we have to persist at a scientific level. Keep studying → look at more data → research more → learn → collect more data → review → reiterate → etc. We can find insight today in all the data we collect and keep in silos (or in paper files), and in medical, court, police, and, even, shelter records. We can add data from all over the world, and find rich insights. We can find critical moments, actions, failures - all from data we already have, but are not sharing. If we (data scientists, technology developers, doctors/farmers and patients) can overcome problems of intense weather and complex health problems (which we do more and more), why can’t we also overcome problems that involve some mentality/mental health and social power confluences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I recovered from my shock over what the young woman said, I turned to a favourite letter of Rosalind Franklin, who faced the complexity of researching the existence of DNA. She wrote: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… you look at science (or at least talk of it) as some sort of demoralizing invention of man, something apart from real life, and which must be cautiously guarded and kept separate from everyday existence. But &lt;strong&gt;science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated&lt;/strong&gt;. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life. In so far as it goes, it is based on fact, experience and experiment. Your theories are those which you and many other people find easiest and pleasantest to believe, but so far as I can see, they have no foundation other than they leaf to a pleasanter view of life (and an exaggerated idea of our own importance)… - &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/KR/p-nid/183&quot;&gt;Letter to Ellis Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, mid-1900s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump forward, to today, with me. Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services recently hosted big events in London, and each of them has a “your organisational culture will change” component to their new cloud-based offers. They are using exactly the same messages we have been using in the Evidence-Based-Policy community for years&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and before that, Critical Studies (as an academic field) identified the needs for cultural shifts to enable logical decisions for society. I am really happy to see that the world of tech (or at least some of the most visionary leaders) have understood that being evidence-based, or using science, means that we have to change the hierarchies in organisations (some members will no longer “feel exaggerated ideas of our own importance”), and we have to make people comfortable with a new foundation of respect between different people in different roles in (and not in) our organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am launching some collaborative open data projects (as are others), now, and they begin with the notion that, if we want to collect a lot of data and we want it to be the right data, then we must involve many stakeholders. They will work with analysts to figure out what is important to capture and both types of participants will work (together) to capture high quality data. Stakeholders and analysts can surprise each other with insights found over a beautiful, high quality data set. It is a really cool new world, which does require bravery and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not that it was necessary before, either, but the past is the past. I am focused on moving into the future, and doing it better than leaders of the past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See, for example a report I worked on for The Way Ahead for Civil Society in London: Data Sharing, at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewayahead.london/sites/default/files/uploads/DataSharingforTheWayAheadFinalReport100417.pdf&quot;&gt;http://thewayahead.london/sites/default/files/uploads/DataSharingforTheWayAheadFinalReport100417.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I honestly wondered if one of the Google gurus used my little webinar from last autumn. &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/BfCHx5&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/BfCHx5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Evaluation, Data Protection and Innovation Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop will help you learn about the upcoming changes to Data Protection law (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR&lt;/a&gt;) in relation to evaluation data, for both existing data and future data collection. During the interactive sessions, you will master new terms and concepts covering GDPR, Linked and Open Data, and the role a Theory of Change can play in data strategy design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exciting afternoon promises to help you: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate data collection and evaluation under the GDPR with practical advice and guidance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet (and begin collaborating with) other professionals dealing with data in their day-to-day work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get to know leaders in data innovation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tsip.co.uk/&quot;&gt;The Social Innovation Partnership (TSIP)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Digital Catapult Centre&lt;/a&gt;, the interactive workshop will be presented in four parts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tsip.co.uk/ajax/people/2455&quot;&gt;Adrienne Monteath-van Dok&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tsip.co.uk/&quot;&gt;TSIP&lt;/a&gt; will introduce the role that a Theory of Change can play in data design. Adrienne will use Camp Ballot, a mock organisation that collects data in real time via SMS to improve the quality of services offered to refugees in refugee camps, to help you work through the data challenges you face with a safe and practical example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrpwilliams/&quot;&gt;Jen Williams&lt;/a&gt;, Software Developer and Data Consultant from &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet&lt;/a&gt;, will further build on this example, explaining the world of Open and Linked Data and guiding a discussion of how thinking across the web-of-data could support Camp Ballot’s mission. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thersa.org/fellowship/find-a-fellow/profile/128435&quot;&gt;Lea Gorgulu Webb&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet&lt;/a&gt; (a lawyer and data strategist) will then provide an overview of the GDPR in the UK (given the current status of Brexit), again, using Camp Ballot to gain experience working with the data protection laws of the EU and UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you’ve mastered the main elements of the GDPR, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/about/our-team/&quot;&gt;Lucie Burgess&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Digital Catapult Centre&lt;/a&gt; will discuss innovative concepts and approaches to help you comply with data protection and privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session will end with details of where to turn for further help, followed by networking drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a manager, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) professional or responsible for data in your organisation, this session is for you if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to provide guidance and informed leadership advice to an agency that works with people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You understand that there are serious and institution-threatening penalties for failing to handle data carefully&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are a professional who works with data, but data and data design is not your realm of expertise &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are considering what to provide to your teams for training over the next year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You would like to meet other professionals and managers in the public, social and tech sectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costs: £90 (Book by 31st July for our Early Bird price: £60) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancellation policy:         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If cancelled by mid-August attendees will receive a full refund.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If cancelled by September 1st attendees will receive a 50% refund.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If cancelled by September 12th attendees will receive a 25% refund.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And after this date there will be no monetary refunds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attendees can transfer their tickets to someone else should their plans change (but please notify the organiser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop date: &lt;strong&gt;20th September&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timings: 13:30 – 18:00 (networking drinks from 16:45)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Social Innovation (DSI) involves people, and it is time for evaluation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is Friday morning, and I feel like the week lasted about 20 minutes. During the busy week, though, I learned, worked, and began creating even more in this space of innovation that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent two days at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nesta.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Nesta&lt;/a&gt; events. One was a terrific day of learning with other Digital Social Innovators. The programme of speakers was excellent. Whether they were organising volunteers from the tech industry to help people in need (Techfugees) or working as city leaders to transform ancient cities into communities that work better for more people (Barcelona, Milan, Amsterdam), they were really bright and well-trained people who work to make the world a kinder place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two themes that were dominant and are very important: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;digital social innovation requires contact with people, and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we have to start measuring the impact of the efforts to digitally socially innovate&lt;/strong&gt; (just like we do in the rest of the always innovative, social service world).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/dsi/codefirst.png&quot; alt=&quot;illustration showing a person saying &amp;quot;what?! people?! But I have a GREAT idea for the way we can write code to solve many social problems!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t enjoy saying, “I told you so.”  I do enjoy getting on with the work that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, at NetworkedPlanet, and in the social innovation communities have to base our innovations on what we learn from people. Whether we are developing an app or a test or a research project or an education programme. The people with which we engage might not even be potential users of what we are producing.  In Barcelona, the Chief Technology Officer, Francesca Bria, spoke passionately about sending researchers out to collect information from persons who do not use any technology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital social innovation is innovation FOR ALL of society.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Francesca Bria, Chief Technology Officer for Barcelona, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/what-next-digital-social-innovation-realising-potential-people-and-technology-tackle-social-challenges&quot;&gt;“What next for digital social innovation?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what we are doing at NetworkedPlanet, with our targeted combination of technology, data specialists, social science, and community leadership. We are building projects around problems that are repeatedly identified by people, and for which the web-of-data can be used as a powerful tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we have to start measuring, testing, and studying whether what we are doing is working… or not… or if we even have a valid theory about why we are doing it. This might be rather new to digital social innovators, but the world of social services has loads of resources and knowledge to lend!  I became a data strategist in order to help charities get the data collected to enable meaningful learning about programmes (whether or not they are working, how they are working, what is working, and what is not). The same analytical methods can be applied to digital innovations, and it is a fabulous way to get a product right! Without evaluation - by researchers who know how to approach the development curves of innovation - we can’t argue that what we are doing is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://networkedplanet.com/contact/&quot;&gt;send me a note&lt;/a&gt; if you want to have an evaluation consultation. The good news is, that measuring impact and producing reports about findings can be really easy when you have a few technical skills. So, you are one step ahead of loads of social innovators that are not in the DSI space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for such a great event Nesta!  You are a gem!  I’m going to get on with what needs to be done, now. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stakeholder Engagement in Data Sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a project called The Way Ahead: The Future of Support for London’s Civil Society for the last few months&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It offered a chance to work on designing a great data sharing strategy (foundation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project started by meeting people from “civil society” organisations in London. Many of these organisations are very small or operate in only a single community. It was really nice to meet them and work with them, but raised this odd conundrum of how I introduce myself. I find it difficult to briefly reveal the full range of my consultancies. When I introduce myself as a Data Strategist, I think some people take an impression that I am unlike other social researchers - maybe people assume that I am purely interested in numbers and tech. If I introduce myself as an impact evaluator, they don’t understand why I focus on data and getting the use of tech right. The truth is, I am a mathsy, techy, social scientist. Data strategy, for me, begins with the messiness of humanity. I relish the imperfect and human side of social science, and in social science practice, I press to work as much as possible with stakeholders, because it helps figure out how to best understand and organise data issues. It isn’t something that a lot of organisations expect of a data strategist, but data strategy is like any other evidence-based practice - it is best when stakeholders are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the way stakeholder engagement can make data richer. I will use myself as an easy and available example. I was a stakeholder engaged in the process of developing The Way Ahead. Like experimenting with inoculation&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, though, I’ll be careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first question for me as a researcher and data strategist is who are the stakeholders… today?&lt;/strong&gt; Why “today”? Because when pulling together a data strategy for ongoing, multi-issue, research data, the answer changes constantly. One day, we consider the end beneficiary, and another day we are consider data users. At another moment, we might consider data providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the categories of stakeholders are full of diversity. The end beneficiary can be anyone who has any contact with the issues affected by civil society. That really includes everyone I can think of – a real cradle-to-grave range… with billions of different experiences. It includes settled residents, commuters (like me), visitors, and internationals who may never be physically in London, men, women, every sexual orientation, every look, every language, every ability, every happiness, and every sadness. It even includes pets, wildlife, and the environment. I can go on for ages, here. I am just one of a near infinite number of stakeholders. Today, I am commuter, adult, woman, parent, educated, fortunate, English-speaking, literate, and working remotely via the internet. I can’t afford to live in London. I’m not a British citizen. I can see and hear and walk. I have seasonal allergies.  Any of these traits might make me a stakeholder in a research project in London. Likewise, they might exclude me as a stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, get this: If we just consider me as a commuter, and do a few seconds internet search for, “data about London commuters,” we get a report from two years ago. It is from the Greater London Authority. It summarizes some statistics calculated from the 2011 census data&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is what it says about commuters, in brief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Sentences in the 2011 Census Data about Commuters&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;How typical am I of these stakeholders? Why does it matter?&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18 per cent of people who worked in London commute from outside the capital.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I am not alone. I am part of a minority. It is a significant part of the workforce, though.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Those who commuted-in were more likely to be male, in managerial/professional occupations, and more likely to work in Finance/Insurance or Public Administration than their London-resident counterparts.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Oh, well, I am not totally typical. This is good to know. Sometimes, my view or need, as a stakeholder, will reflect a different gender-experience, a different income stream, etc., than most of the rest of the group.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;On average, commuters are older than those who lived and worked in London.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(First thought: Aargh. Don’t remind me.) More reasoned thought: Interesting, I am sure we have some age-related issues to consider sometimes. (Like how much more awesome we are as we age!)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Individuals living outside London were more likely to commute to the capital for work if they reported non-White British ethnicity. Those with Black ethnicity were five times more likely than their White British counterparts to commute to London.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I am not British - related to this lack of native-experience is that the term “Black Ethnicity” doesn’t really make any sense to me. I might miss lots of local meanings to common English words. I might not always understand or communicate as clearly as a native Britain.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;In the week before census those working in London travelled a total of 39.7 million miles&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;from their residences to their work. Assuming that this distance was travelled twice a day, in a five day week London workers commuted the equivalent of travelling from Earth to the Sun and back.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;This could spark loads of snarky remarks from me, but seriously, it underscores that considering commuters is reasonable, as this is a big number of miles travelled.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in my chart above, I want to know about stakeholders, but I must be careful not to assume they are representative of the wider audience/target/group. Collecting information from stakeholders does not necessarily mean that it is true, but more that there are times when it seems true to the stakeholder (I would not describe myself as older, for example). Stakeholders are always individuals. Few individuals are perfect samples of any group, unless it is a group of one. One of the reasons we get to know stakeholders, though, is to decide what issues to look into further. The data is best, when it has actual individuals, participating as stakeholders, and good quantitative data, letting us check the weight we give to the guidance of the stakeholder. When I find that there is a barrier to certain stakeholders showing up in the data, then I have to really dig in and figure out how to remedy the exclusion, and be open to the fact that the quantitative data is faulty in some ways. Improving granularity, or what we can see in the detail of data, sometimes means we are simply describing a section of the data that is missing. Understanding and communicating the complexity of the data adds real value to the analysis and findings of any report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have countless examples of how more granular data allows us to find insights that really change peoples lives for the better, and I soon become really excited, when I consider the possibilities of who the stakeholder is! Let’s consider the wide breadth of London data stakeholders again. Who might my work affect? Maybe we will design a strategy that ends up helping a young person escape violence and grow up feeling safe in London! Or maybe we’ll help create the solution for a working parent who needs to take a sick child to the doctor during a break from work! Maybe we’ll manage to create the right data strategy for cyclists to ride through London without risk of being in a fatal accident! This is why I love my job! There are endless ways that my little part of strategising can help create awesomeness in a place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other stakeholders, who are not end-beneficiaries. When we move up the chain (away from the beneficiary and toward the digital information), we encounter the social workers, the housing providers, the stalkers (who might want data for destructive reasons), the police, the policy analysts, the politicians, the app developers, the data visualisation professionals, and on and on. Each problem brings a different collection of data users and providers. Sometimes that means we will want the data to be held in a different way and shared in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are everywhere. It can seem overwhelming. We’re able to decide who are the stakeholders of the moment and narrow our list by focusing our work on one problem/issue at a time. Like: how do we solve the problem of inequality between men and women (or White British and Black Ethnicity) in  managerial and professional roles, in London’s financial sector? Who are the stakeholders? How can they help design our research? What barriers to their involvement do we know of? Where should meetings and working groups convene? Etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Way Ahead report, we recommended a plan that allows for constant stakeholder engagement, problem focus, and flexibility. It will seem very un-techy to many readers, because the tech comes secondarily to getting the data strategy right, and a good data strategy begins with stakeholder engagement!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the report is published, you can see it at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lvsc.org.uk/programmes/the-way-ahead.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.lvsc.org.uk/programmes/the-way-ahead.aspx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;I cannot give the impression that I did anything alone in this project. I had a great time working closely with Kate White (of Superhighways) and dozens of collaborators. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sort of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Wortley_Montagu&quot;&gt;Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not going to discuss the age of the data. There are other places to get information that allows for improvement of the data. That is a discussion for another day.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Way Ahead - Data Sharing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;http://londonfunders.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/SME574%20London%20Funders%20Report_For%20Web.pdf&quot;&gt;The Review of the Future of Civil Society Support in London&lt;/a&gt; was published by London Funders, working closely with Greater London Volunteering and the London Voluntary Service Council. The Review’s emerging findings report The Change Ahead described the rapidly and dramatically changing world in which civil society operates. The Review Team believed that &lt;strong&gt;organisations and individuals that support civil society need to adapt, evolve and innovate at a systems-wide level&lt;/strong&gt; to address these changes, so that the best outcomes can be achieved for Londoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report made twelve recommendations for action, gathered under five key themes, each addressed by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewayahead.london/about/task-and-finish-groups&quot;&gt;Task and Finish group&lt;/a&gt;. In November, Lea began working with Kate White (of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superhighways.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Superhighways&lt;/a&gt;), co-chairing the Task and Finish group for the “Data Sharing” theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead proposes a system that puts London’s communities at the heart of the way we all work.  It begins with co-producing an understanding of need and how to tackle it with our communities, through to better sharing of intelligence and data across all sectors, and making sure that civil society’s voice is heard in decision-making at a strategic level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/twa/parts.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Way Ahead - Twelve Recommendations&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data-sharing-theme&quot;&gt;The Data Sharing Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The GLA (Greater London Authority) currently plays an important role for other sectors in collating data, analysing it and making it accessible. Civil society is a large and important contributor to London, and as such the GLA should extend its data role to encompass civil society.  As co-produced needs data is developed, it could be pulled together by the GLA. Over time, this data would provide a clearer and shared understanding of need as it evolves across London, which is accepted by funders, civil society and communities themselves, and could be incorporated into strategic planning at all levels.  Data about the sector itself is also important for planning, for example on the size, location and nature of civil society in different areas of London as it correlates to communities needs; the nature of volunteers, including where they volunteer, and to what issues they contribute.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Data Sharing Task and Finish group was set up, Lea and Kate have been meeting with funders, voluntary sector leaders, and charities in order to produce a report of recommendations to The Way Ahead’s steering group. The report has now been submitted, but the work doesn’t end here! To stay up to date with news, visit the newly launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewayahead.london/&quot;&gt;thewayahead.london&lt;/a&gt; website. We’ll also continue to post updates here on the blog about the intelligence gathered during our meetings throughout The Way Ahead’s Data Sharing research. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DataDock and CSVW</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we publish anything on the web it should go without saying that in order for that distributed information to be usable, we must adhere to standards when we publish it. If everyone had their own way of marking some text in a web page to be &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, web page browsers would have an impossible task of displaying that text in the way it was meant to be shown. That’s why we have the standard markup language of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/html/&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; to enable everyone to publish web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when we publish data on the web we should look to standards to ensure consistency and interoperability between distributed data publishers and any applications that need to pull that data into their systems. DataDock currently makes use of two main recommended approaches to publishing data on the web - “CSV on the Web” (CSVW) and Linked Data. This blog post will concentrate on CSVW and there will be a follow up for those interested in Linked Data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;DataDock&lt;/a&gt;’s processing pipeline is to take a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Comma Separated Values&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/abbr&gt; file of tabular data, and open it to allow the DataDock user some basic control over how that data should be processed. Whilst the current amount of user control over the CSV processing is straightforward datatype selection of the different columns, we will be rapidly expanding DataDock’s abilities to allow more user control over defining the structure of the CSV they are publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/csvw/columns.png&quot; alt=&quot;CSV columns list&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The W3C’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;CSV on the Web Working Group&lt;/a&gt; developed specifications relating to describing tabular data. This makes it the obvious choice for us to adopt this standard when we pull the CSV into the DataDock processing pipeline. There is now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/community/csvw/&quot;&gt;W3C CSV on the Web Community Group that is open to all&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a focus on discussion and support for implementors, publishers and spec developers to share experience with CSVW and related ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the CSVW specification, DataDock takes the information entered by the user (e.g. title / description / selected license) and combines it with the list of columns to produce a metadata JSON file. An example of one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jennet/odcamp-demo/blob/gh-pages/csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv-metadata.json&quot;&gt;metadata JSON files&lt;/a&gt; produced during the import of a CSV into DataDock is shown below (the example below only shows the first four of the columns for brevity):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jennet/1b681faa594f86a2a417302c96600575.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current release, DataDock auto-creates the column definitions, creating the machine-friendly &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;property_url&lt;/code&gt; from each column’s header value, which is set as the initial value in &lt;code&gt;titles&lt;/code&gt;. DataDock currently asks for user input only when it comes to the column’s &lt;code&gt;datatype&lt;/code&gt;, although it does make a simple guess at the datatype based on the values of the first non-header row of the selected CSV. Future upgrades to the DataDock platform will make use of the more extended definitions of the CSVW standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the CSVW metadata file has been created, DataDock’s conversion process uses the metadata file to generate &lt;abbr title=&quot;Resource Description Framework&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/abbr&gt; linked data. The DataDock then uses the linked data to generate the pages for the data portal, and publishes all this to the user’s target GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each DataDock repository has a “csv” directory that contains a sub-directory for each dataset. This contains the original CSV upload along with its CSVW metadata JSON file. You can find the CSV and CSVW metadata relating to the examples from the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/03/01/connecting-the-dots.html&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jennet/odcamp-demo/tree/gh-pages/csv/Bristol_Monuments.csv&quot;&gt;my GitHub repo here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who want to learn a bit more about CSVW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://greggkellogg.net/%3Fp%3D293&quot;&gt;a more in-depth blog post is available by Gregg Kellogg&lt;/a&gt;, or if you’re a documentation geek then feel free to dive into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;recommendations and notes published by the CSVW working group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that future versions of the DataDock will include an API layer, and that this may handle more complex CSV processing using supplied metadata files. If that’s something that you would be interested in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NetworkedPlanet/datadock/issues&quot;&gt;make it known as a feature request&lt;/a&gt; on our support site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next blog post will dive into the linked data part of the publishing pipeline. It’s that side of things that the most exciting for me personally, because as we add enhancements to the CSVW &lt;code&gt;property_url&lt;/code&gt; definition user control, we can add features to publish and reuse standard vocabulary terms to define the data published from disparate sources - whilst keeping this standard of data publishing free and as easy as possible for non-technical people to use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecting the dots in your data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get stuck into the more technical aspects of DataDock, I’d like to first show a little example of one of the benefits of having a deep-dive data portal, over that of a catalog of datasets. If you’ve not yet read it, have a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/02/28/introducing-datadock.html&quot;&gt;Introduction to DataDock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many data publishing platforms provide a list of the datasets you’ve published. Good ones will include additional information about that dataset (this is known as the metadata). Simplistic catalog offerings, however, can;t display the information from multiple datasets without additional visualisation modules that need to be manually configured to display information from disparate datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By choosing identifiers when you upload data to DataDock, you can upload additional information that pertains to those records later on, and your data portal will automatically group that information together for display in the data portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best explained in a walk-through of connecting up three datasets I added to my own data portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selecting-the-data&quot;&gt;Selecting the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I went on the hunt for some open data that would be useful to show this functionality. I found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/Land-Use/Bristol-Monuments/nyj9-igak&quot;&gt;interesting dataset detailing archaeological / historic structures&lt;/a&gt; on the Bristol City Council’s beta open data platform. It’s published under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode&quot;&gt;public domain (CC-0) license&lt;/a&gt; meaning I have the right to reproduce it elsewhere. The dataset was available in CSV (comma separated value) format and most importantly it also included a &lt;strong&gt;Monument Record Number&lt;/strong&gt; that I quickly checked that there were no duplicates or missing values - perfect for use as the DataDock identifier for each record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_preview.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the data preview of the Bristol Monuments data&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uploading-to-datadock&quot;&gt;Uploading to DataDock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, DataDock produces identifiers for each of the records in your spreadsheet using the row number, but to be able to add extra information in the future, we want an identifier that will work across datasets. As mentioned above, I’d seen that the &lt;code&gt;MONUMENT_RECORD_NO&lt;/code&gt; suited an identifier and so I selected this from the drop-down list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_identifiers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting the identifier&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viewing-the-data&quot;&gt;Viewing the data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the import job was completed, I can use the buttons on my dashboard to view my data portal, and dive into the data using the &lt;code&gt;exampleResource&lt;/code&gt; links. See how the fact I selected the Monument Record Number has affected the addresses of the records in the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://datadock.io/jennet/odcamp-demo/id/resource/&lt;strong&gt;monument_record_no&lt;/strong&gt;/1054M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating to this record in a web browser shows us all the information pertaining to that record. This is known as the “resource page” for a particular record in your dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page for a single record from the dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merging-data-from-a-different-dataset&quot;&gt;Merging data from a different dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a second spreadsheet that contained the specific latitude and longitude of each monument, along with the monument record number of course. I wanted to add this data as the original data only listed the location as a combined field of (lat, long). 
 During the upload of the second spreadsheet I again selected the &lt;code&gt;MONUMENT_RECORD_NO&lt;/code&gt; as my DataDock identifier. Once the import job had completed I can refresh the resource page and see that my additional data from the separate dataset is shown on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page now showing additional data from the second dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connecting-the-dots---linking-in&quot;&gt;Connecting the dots - linking in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use those same identifiers to link &lt;strong&gt;into&lt;/strong&gt; the resources that we’ve published through other datasets. To demonstrate this I wrote a dummy survey report noting “damage” to the monuments. In the survey data we use the addresses of the monument resources instead of their number or name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/dummy_damage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dummy damage report&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I choose the damage report ID as my identifier, and upload the dataset for conversion and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-catalog&quot;&gt;Data catalog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process this has also meant that each dataset has been added to the dataset catalog on my data portal landing page. The data catalog lists each of my datasets along with any other information I added during upload, such as the license, a title, description, and keyword tags. It also shows the data download links for the complete dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/data_catalog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data catalog lisr&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more interesting is how the data from these separate datasets can appear in a single web resource through the use of identifiers and we can see how even data that points &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the resource can be shown on that resource page too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datadock/bristol_monuments_resource3.png&quot; alt=&quot;The resource page now showing incoming links from the third dataset&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve found this simple walkthrough helpful in demonstrating the benefits of being able to connect your data. We’re able to explore data in a way that goes beyond the boundaries of each separate dataset or spreadsheet is their source. Identifiers are the key concept in this way of thinking about connecting data. If you’re interested in having a play around, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;DataDock.io&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing DataDock</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to publish some data, what do you do next? As we’ve mentioned before, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/08/10/opening-up-your-data.html&quot;&gt;publishing data shouldn’t cost the earth&lt;/a&gt;, but that there are some technical challenges to be faced when we want that data to be discoverable, accessible and usable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, technical challenges mean resource challenges; even when data publishing software is free or open-source, it can mean that you require someone with the technical know-how to set it all up (and keep it running), and the resources to run the server to hold the software. In so many cases, these technical and resource challenges basically block individuals and smaller organisations from being able to publish data effectively or at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that taking your first steps in publishing your data shouldn’t be this hard. We have the technical skills and expertise in data publishing standards to be able to provide that publishing service in a way that eliminates those barriers. Over the last few months we’ve been building the answer to those challenges, and we’ve called it DataDock. We’ve now &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;released it as a preview edition&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it’s ready to be used by the open data community, and that we’ll be collecting feedback while we work on some additional features over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-deep-dive-data-portal-in-a-matter-of-minutes&quot;&gt;Have a deep-dive data portal in a matter of minutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your spreadsheet, select a license, then let DataDock do all the magic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That magic provides you with a data portal home page, which lists a dataset for each of your spreadsheets. The data portal shows useful information about each dataset and clear licensing information, along with links to download the original spreadsheet and the data in other formats. You can also click into the dataset itself, as DataDock creates pages for every record in your data, allowing you to deep-dive into your published data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-worry-about-the-techno-babble&quot;&gt;Don’t worry about the techno-babble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our main aims is to try and eliminate as much as possible all the jargon and techno-babble surrounding data publishing. DataDock handles the magic, freeing you up to concentrate on the data itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-hold-of-your-data&quot;&gt;Keep hold of your data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the standards-compliant data produced by DataDock is published to your GitHub account. You can turn off DataDock’s access any time you wish, and keep all the data it produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-based&quot;&gt;Cloud-based&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to buy web-hosting, DataDock sits in the cloud and we will always provide free accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got hundreds of ideas for enhancements and features for DataDock, and we’d like to work on the things you want most. Get involved on by requesting features or up-voting existing requests on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NetworkedPlanet/datadock/issues&quot;&gt;DataDock support site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-for-the-geeks-too&quot;&gt;It’s for the geeks too&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t want to bore you with that right now. Standards geeks and linked data nerds will be interested in reading the follow ups to this blog post to learn more about the CSVW and 5-star linked data standards that are at the core of DataDock’s internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in having a play around, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://datadock.io&quot;&gt;DataDock.io&lt;/a&gt; and check it out. We’d love to hear from you about what you’d like it to do in the future. Upgrades to DataDock won’t effect the data you’ve published, they’ll simply add features to your future uploads, so feel free to get stuck in even at this preview stage. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Co-operative Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, a confession: I went along to Open:2017 without a very clear idea about what a platform co-operative really was. I had been asked to get involved due to my work relating to Linked Data, and whilst I had read up a little bit on platform co-ops I only really had a vague idea that it was “sort of like doing something like AirBnB or Uber but without exploiting those using the platform”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came away not only with a clearer idea of what a platform co-op is (I’ll get into that in a minute), but also with a real hunger for finding a way of adopting this approach in future projects. So what is this approach? Most people are aware of co-operatives - where groups of people have come together to form an entity to manage something like a building or buildings to live in (housing co-ops), a business (worker co-ops) or a food shop or cafe (consumer co-ops), amongst other things. What they all have in common is the drive to create entities where the people who take part in that co-op can become members who actively participate (if they wish) in the running of the co-op itself. Any profits are then shared amongst the members and/or ploughed back into the co-op itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With platform co-operatives, instead of members coming together around a physical building or a business that’s usually fairly localised, the “hub” is a digital platform. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stocksy.com/&quot;&gt;Stocksy&lt;/a&gt; is a stock photography platform that’s owned and run by all of their photographers. I must admit I still get a bit confused as to why they went with “platform co-operative” rather than “digital co-operative”, but then again I also complain that calling things “digital” isn’t specific enough, so I admit I’m difficult to please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than me continue to badly explain co-operatives and platform co-ops, here’s a few links to read up some more if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uk.coop/about/about-co-operatives-uk&quot;&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the conference, the first session I took part in was a panel with Tim Davies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendataservices.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Data Services Co-op&lt;/a&gt;) and Karin Christiansen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://okfn.org/&quot;&gt;Open Knowledge Foundation&lt;/a&gt;) called “From data slaves to data citizens”. The session was intended to be a discussion around open data, but ended up being primarily about user’s fear of the intentions and uses of data collected by platforms that had become so monolithic that it was difficult to have a digital presence without signing up to their services. The second session I was helping to present focused on content from Matt Wallis from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/&quot;&gt;Institute of Solidarity Economics&lt;/a&gt; who have adopted a Linked Data focused approach to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://solidarityeconomics.org/our-work/internal-projects/&quot;&gt;data infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. I was really pleased to see that a large proportion of the attendees were comfortable with Linked Data already. My gut feeling is that in this environment filled with people working with such commitment to collaboration and information sharing, Linked Data is obviously not new to them, as it provides the standard for collaborating effectively at a data management and sharing level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session I was directly involved with was “Designing interoperable apps for the open app ecosystem”, a lengthy 2 hour workshop session led by Laura Hilliger, Enric Senebre Hidalgo and Ricard Espelt. They did a great job facilitating the structure, creating smaller discussion groups over particular topics brainstormed at the start of the session. The discussion continues over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;discuss.open.coop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A pitch idea bubbling for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODcamp&quot;&gt;@ODcamp&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/opencoop?src=hash&quot;&gt;#opencoop&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;how can platform co-ops benefit the open data ecosystem?&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/crosspollination?src=hash&quot;&gt;#crosspollination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Networked Planet (@nwplanet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nwplanet/status/832970665565224960&quot;&gt;February 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what next? Well, my mind is buzzing about all sort of things. From the interoperable apps session, I’d love to hear about people pushing forward with publishing open data vocabularies for use in linked data publishing. Oli from Open Co-op is hoping to rekindle the Collaborative Technology Alliance’s efforts (more info &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.open.coop/t/open-2017-designing-interoperable-apps-for-the-open-app-ecosystem/58&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m interested to see if linked data plays a part in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically about platform co-ops, I’m wondering if our new cloud service that goes live in alpha/preview mode this weekend would be suitable for a platform co-operative, and what the logistics of that would be. The value systems certainly align, but would the administrative needs fit? I don’t know yet but I’m going to continue to delve deeper to answer my questions around that. In a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; timely blog post from the ODI, Tom Sasse asks the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://theodi.org/news/how-can-open-data-portals-become-sustainable-new-report-makes-recommendations-from-design-to-evaluation&quot;&gt;“How can open data portals become sustainable?”&lt;/a&gt; - perhaps platform co-operatives hold the answer. I’m hoping others may want to discuss this sort of thing with me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk/&quot;&gt;ODCamp&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, so expect a pitch from me around this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I’ve come away from Open:2017 with a lot of questions buzzing around my head, but also a real sense of purpose and positivity. I’d really like to spread the word about the people who attended and their projects and platforms, however I don’t currently have a full list, as a starting point here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/open_coop/lists/open-2017-contributors/members&quot;&gt;twitter list of contributors to the conference&lt;/a&gt; (those involved in panels and presenting sessions). If you were at the conference please feel free to add details and pointers to your work in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there’s an Open:2018, it was a fantastic event. Keep an eye on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.coop/&quot;&gt;Open Co-op&lt;/a&gt; do next!&lt;/p&gt;
