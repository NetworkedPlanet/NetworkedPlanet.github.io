        <title>The Way Ahead for London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t run.  I am going to write a frightening word, but we can face it together: Co-production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. I did it. As an impact evaluator, I often have to help clients find ways to really co-produce data and evaluations, and it is not, often, something that happens without some failures. This can be frightening, because time is always of the essence and because funders want co-production (even when they don’t do it very well).  It is proven to be transformative, though.  It is worth doing and doing well, and it is worth learning from failure at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am endeavouring to practice the things I preach as I work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lvsc.org.uk/future-of-civil-society-support-in-london-latest-update/work-with-us-to-achieve-the-ambitions-of-the-way-ahead-for-londoners.aspx&quot;&gt;The Way Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.  The project seeks to build an infrastructure to help Civil Society organisations, which is as co-produced as possible.  I am only working on the data sharing aspects, but studies have shown that open databases for civil society, which are co-produced, are more used and (assumably) more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of work to do.  London is a large and very diverse community.  We are going to have to pull our sleeves up and hit the streets, call all partners, think outside the box, and continually look at our stats to see if we are making any headway.  We will also be able to gather information about various communities from digital resources, and we can use scholarship about populations, as well.  The work requires real care, because simply having someone who identifies with a certain group, does not equal having a representative of the group.  We can gather insights from individuals, and then investigate those insights, true, but that is not co-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-production is a process and a product by which we provide an ongoing method for various stakeholders to be involved in, and provide insight to, research.  The work of co-production often begins by identifying many different stakeholder groups and then finding out how to introduce your project, exhibit listening, and repeat. With each iteration, we gain some insight. Sometimes the new insight is from failure. Such is the nature of learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I am part of a large minority in London, an immigrant from America. There are more than 60,000 of us living in London.  Never assume that any opinion I have is anything like any other American, or even like other Americans in London. You will probably be very wrong. No one person can actually speak for large and diverse populations.  BUT, if I tell you that I don’t want to come to your meeting about the data sharing project because I think it is only for people who were born in Britain and have a British accent, then: you have some insight worth investigating.  Are non-UK born people not attending the events because of this perception? Something else? Or is it many things?  By letting other non-UK-born persons know that you have heard the voice of one, you might encourage others to speak up, and then, you may find barriers that inhibit many from a group with a particular situation. (Maybe I am the only one who is intimidated by British accents.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is wonderful and fascinating work, co-producing, and I’ll keep you updated about our strategies and success or failure, here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I sent out various notices about the meeting in other languages, and I began looking for non-English language radio.  I got a warm reception, which is a good start.  We shall see how it goes.  We’ll also be reaching out to different age groups (and diverse different age groups!), of course, and monitoring involvement by diverse people of various levels of education.  It takes a whole range of people to get this right.  If you want to help, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;be in touch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Keys to a Successful Data Strategy for Charities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This one hour presentation by Lea is aimed at board members, directors, managers and leaders 
of charities, non-profits and social enterprises. Starting with the challenges that these 
organisations face around the collection, processing and use of data; the presentation 
describes the key ways in which leaders can effectively define and implement a data strategy 
and promote evidence informed decision making within their organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Key Data Innovations to Ensure Your Organisation Survives and Thrives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Charity leaders will learn about data protection and how to lead organisations toward better collection and use of data at our workshop at the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in London on the 10th of November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will review and explore data protection and privacy laws to gain a comfort level that allows participants to lead, wisely, onward, before we delve into new priorities for data collection and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a true workshop, allowing participants to gain a solid footing on issues that often result in wasted time and energy at charities. The goal is to equip leaders to empower their staff toward the big goals of the organisation - making major gains in efforts to create a better world.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring the Impact of Open Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was happy to find widespread agreement about our ideas for the need to measure impact of open data policies, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatacon.org/&quot;&gt;International Open Data Conference&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion that we can better guide organisations into a proper data stewardship plan, if we have some way of valuing the various parts of the plan.  I know, some of you are thinking that this will rain on the parade, but measuring the impact of open data policies will not be uneventful.  Wandering into this new field of impact and benefit analysis will be full of excitement and surprises.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first evaluations will begin to answer questions about what is already valuable and what indicators are helpful for determining the value of an open data set.  We won’t be alone in the conversation, and the field won’t stop growing and developing.  Studying the value, though, will help organisations make better decisions and invest more meaningfully in sharing data and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on this? Use the comments section below for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Partners Sought in Data-for-Good Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-a-new-series-of-tools-to-help-find-the-solutions-to-the-worlds-problems&quot;&gt;Launching a new series of tools to help find the solutions to the world’s problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;announcement-partners-sought-in-data-for-good-project&quot;&gt;Announcement: Partners Sought in Data-for-Good Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, NetworkedPlanet has turned a corner. Our company has long managed data, and we are among the vanguard in managing open-linked data, globally.  The world of big data focuses largely on for-profit and consumer insights. We, however, are turning our sights to social problems and the organisations who want to use data-for-good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to join us?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for organisations that seek to solve a social, health, or environmental problem, and understand that more data can lead to innovation and insights.  We intend to design bespoke systems to use linkable data from various locations and sectors to provide the cause with a powerful new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in projects that aim to: relieve suffering; improves the health of the environment; or address disease.  We are especially interested in projects that have more than one sector of interest in terms of data (for example, environmental data and health data, or law enforcement and social data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will review letters of interest in early November and meet with prospective partners in late November (2016). Meetings may be held via Goto Meeting, if you are based outside of the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be considered, please send a short letter explaining the interests of your organisation, and providing contact details, to: Lea@networkedplanet.com before 29 October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;networkedplanet-est-buscando-socios-en-el-desarrollo-de-nuevas-herramientas-para-la-investigacin&quot;&gt;NetworkedPlanet está buscando socios en el desarrollo de nuevas herramientas para la investigación.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;queremos-anunciar-un-proyecto-para-utilizar-los-datos-para-buenos-fines-sociales&quot;&gt;Queremos anunciar: Un proyecto para utilizar los datos para buenos fines sociales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Este mes, NetworkedPlanet (de Gran Bretaña) anuncia una nueva dirección. NetworkedPlanet conseguido datos, y que se encuentran entre la vanguardia en la gestión de los datos ligados y abiertas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mientras que el mundo de los grandes datos se centra principalmente en los conocimientos con fines de lucro y de consumo, nos volvemos nuestra mirada a los problemas sociales y las organizaciones que deseen utilizar los datos para la buena. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¿Desea Su organización unirse a nosotros? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buscamos a las organizaciones que tratan de resolver un problema del ambiente, de la salud, o la sociedad, y la organización entienden que un mayor número de datos pueden conducir a la innovación y las ideas. Tenemos la intención de diseñar sistemas a medida para utilizar los datos vinculables de varios lugares y sectores para proporcionar la causa con una nueva y poderosa herramienta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estamos interesados ​​en proyectos que tienen como objetivo: aliviar el sufrimiento; mejora la salud del medio ambiente; o tratar la enfermedad. Estamos especialmente interesados ​​en proyectos que tengan más de un sector de interés en términos de datos (por ejemplo, los datos ambientales y de salud, o por la policía y los datos sociales). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vamos a revisar las cartas de interés a principios de noviembre y se reunirá con los posibles socios a finales de noviembre (2016). Las reuniones podrán ocurer mediante ‘GOTO meeting’ si se basan fuera del Reino Unido. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para ser considerado, por favor envíe una breve carta explicando los intereses de su organización, y con todos los detalles de contacto, a: Lea@networkedplanet.com antes del 29 de octubre de 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Proudly sponsoring - How can public data and information support Bristol charities?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many who work in technology are aware of the untapped potential of data to increase the impact of the charity sector. Those who work in voluntary organisations could benefit from this knowledge but are often restricted by resources in what they can achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bristol.theodi.org/&quot;&gt;ODI Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voscur.org/&quot;&gt;Voscur&lt;/a&gt; have joined forces to run a workshop to bridge this gap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very proud to be sponsoring this event so that these very important conversations can happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon workshop will be taking place on &lt;strong&gt;1pm on Thursday 13th October at Hamilton House on Stokes Croft, Bristol&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/how-can-public-data-and-information-support-bristol-charities-registration-27213285670&quot;&gt;More Info &amp;amp; Sign Up For Event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Nominet Trust published an in-depth review on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/knowledge-centre/articles/open-data-and-charities&quot;&gt;“Open Data and Charities”&lt;/a&gt;, setting out to explain the ways in which open data is increasingly coming in to play a role in the charitable sector:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Existing open government data can be used by charities to add value to their work, to target services better, to improve advocacy and fundraising, and to support knowledge sharing and collaboration between different charities and agencies. Crowdsourcing of open data also offers a new way for charities to gather intelligence, and a wide range of freely available online tools can support charities to analyse open data resources. Realising the potential of open data will require charities to meet a number of technical and organisational challenges. Indeed many charities will need to address key issues relating to open data, whether they choose to pursue benefits from open data or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the challenges faced by resource-restricted organisations is one of our main concerns at Networked Planet, and we believe that to effectively do this the direction must be set by those who are working in the field. We feel that conversations that start from the ground-up are extremely important in the ongoing conversation about furthering the impact of open data, and are happy to be supporting this event both as a sponsor and also the facilitation of the workshop through Jen’s work in the ODI Bristol steering group.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bristol GGD Talk - June 22nd</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Girl Geeks Dinners are monthly events where (predominantly) women meet to network and watch talks over a huge range of tech subjects. When thinking about the best way to present a talk on linked (and open) data, the first thing I thought about was that to do a technical explanation would already be too bamboozling for a mixed crowd. What I needed was to do something more along the lines of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbpRofMqzF0&quot;&gt;World of Linked Open Data video&lt;/a&gt;. With that in mind, I decided that rather than do a whole hour on the tech of linked and open data, I’d ask along some local data heroes. After first doing a #101 style talk about what linked and open data is, I’ll introduce &lt;strong&gt;Martha King&lt;/strong&gt;, who’s doing incredibly interesting work at Knowle West Media centre. There they have been investigating how tech and data can improve the lives of those who live here in Bristol by making use of sensor technology. Finishing up the talks will be &lt;strong&gt;Katherine Rooney&lt;/strong&gt;, project manager for the open data efforts of Connecting Bristol at Bristol City Council. She’ll be talking about the various projects that are already going on in Bristol and also explaining what the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://theodi.org/nodes&quot;&gt;ODI Node&lt;/a&gt; is doing and how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talks (each only around 15 mins), we’ll have space for a Q&amp;amp;A session before the usual community notices and chatting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the details you need are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bristol.girlgeekdinners.com/2016/05/17/ggd52-the-world-of-linked-open-data/&quot;&gt;Bristol Girl Geeks’ website&lt;/a&gt; and you can sign up (spaces are limited) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-Girl-Geek-Dinners/events/231193829/&quot;&gt;BGGD Meetup.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Data Camp 3 - Bristol fashion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I blogged about just how &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/10/13/open-data-camp.html&quot;&gt;impressed I was with Open Data Camp 2&lt;/a&gt;, a free unconference that was held in Manchester. The &lt;strong&gt;un-&lt;/strong&gt;conference format of Open Data Camp (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23odcamp&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#odcamp&lt;/a&gt; as you’ll find people hashtagging) means that each day starts with attendees pitching suggestions for topics, which are then organised into a day incredibly interesting sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of ODCamp2, there was a call out for suggestions for host volunteers and I quickly started working on a two-pronged attack that consisted largely of pestering the ODCamp organisers and also doing a lot of arm-waving back in Bristol to enthuse about what was so great about ODCamp itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-heroes&quot;&gt;Local heroes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for us, there’s an active data geek group in Bristol in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/south-west-data/&quot;&gt;South West Data&lt;/a&gt; who were instrumental in securing the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.watershed.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Watershed&lt;/a&gt; as the venue, and through chats at the South West Data meetups,  Bristol City Council’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.connectingbristol.org/&quot;&gt;Connecting Bristol&lt;/a&gt; got on board with crucial support and sponsorship early on too. ODCamp makes use of several break-out spaces for sessions, and so again we were really lucky to have the support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.watershed.co.uk/pmstudio/&quot;&gt;Pervasive Media Studios&lt;/a&gt;, who allowed us to use their neighbouring meeting spaces next door to the Watershed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a big hat-tip to &lt;strong&gt;Katherine Rooney&lt;/strong&gt; (Connecting Bristol), &lt;strong&gt;Kev Kirkland&lt;/strong&gt; (Data Unity, SWData organiser &amp;amp; resident at Pervasive Media Studios), &lt;strong&gt;Simon Price&lt;/strong&gt; (University of Bristol &amp;amp; SWData organiser) and &lt;strong&gt;Angharad Stone&lt;/strong&gt; (Environment Agency) without whose help ODCamp3 may have never made it to Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-weekend-in-brief&quot;&gt;The weekend in brief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could wax lyrical about the content of ODCamp - but instead I’ll direct you to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/RnROrganisation/open-data-camp-3-mostly-in-pics&quot;&gt;storify of the weekend&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rnrorganisation.co.uk/&quot;&gt;RnR Organisation&lt;/a&gt; - it gives a great overview of what you miss out on when you miss an ODCamp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drawnalism.com/&quot;&gt;Drawnalism&lt;/a&gt; was in attendance again, this time with two illustrators &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; two live-bloggers. You can see the results of the blogging over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://odcamp.org.uk&quot;&gt;odcamp.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; as well as the illustrations, but I’ll pull a few here to give you a taster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;odcamp-4&quot;&gt;ODCamp 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how enjoyable it is to attend an ODCamp, the organisers have the perfect balance of hands-on to keep things moving and sessions on track, and hands-off enough to allow the conference to be built by the people, for the people. Please do sign up for updates and make sure you’re following all the usual channels to hear where and when the next ODCamp will be held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like ODcamp to come to your city, here’s my 3 top tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a potential local venue. It needs to be accessible (no stairs without lifts etc), fairly easy to get to from the local public transport hub (train/bus station) and has a main room that can hold around 60-80 people, with 4 or so smaller break-out spaces that hold 15-20 people (varying sizes are OK)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enlist the support of other local meet up groups. It’s really difficult to do everything without other local enthusiasts - connect with people and team up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the ODCamp organisers know that you’re out trying to find venues and people, if they’re in the dark the next location might get decided while you’re out building support!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;until-next-time&quot;&gt;Until next time!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more on ODCamp, do check out their website and twitter. We’re &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much looking forward to the next one, wherever that may be! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open data feedback at work!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst finishing off my article on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/02/29/linked-data-101-querying.html&quot;&gt;querying linked data&lt;/a&gt;, I decided it would be nice to end with something a little more tangible than simply another SPARQL query. I decided a nice map showing the data that I’d converted from CSV to RDF would do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it was quick work to display a map using OpenStreetMap tiles and Leaflet.js, something was peculiar - the map markers were nowhere to be seen, and scrolling out found them off the coast of Somalia! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datafix/badmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;London allotments in the seas off the coast of Somalia&quot; width=&quot;750px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;These allotments would have problems with damp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started tracing back through my steps and found the culprit in the original CSV file - the headings had been mixed up for the longitude and latitude. I headed back to the London Datastore to double check and yes, that was the way in which the data had been published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking over to their contact page I quickly fired off an e-mail to let them know of the error, and in the matter of a mere &lt;strong&gt;20 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; I had received an email back saying that the data had been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/datafix/goodmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;London allotments in Walthamstow&quot; width=&quot;750px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s more like it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to let simple errors slip by, I know what ranges UK latitudes and longitudes should be and I didn’t spot it even though the &lt;a href=&quot;http://levelup.networkedplanet.com/&quot;&gt;Level Up converter&lt;/a&gt; shows a preview of the original CSV. When working with lots and lots of values it’s easy for things like this to get through and it was the mapping visualisation that made it obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really great is it also shows another benefit of open data, the community aspect of keeping your raw data error-free. Each user of an open dataset has a vested interest in that data being correct. In my case, I wanted it to be able to demonstrate a conversion to RDF, but it could &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; be developers or users of an app that use your data in their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a massive shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LDN_data&quot; title=&quot;London Datastore Twitter&quot;&gt;@ldn_data&lt;/a&gt; for their super fast response in getting the data sorted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Tina-Fey-giving-herself-high-five.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Gif: liz lemon high five&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; class=&quot;img-medium img-responsive center-block bordered-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center img-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You rock!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
